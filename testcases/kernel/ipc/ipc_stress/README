To run these tests run ./testall
On completion you will see a lot of sem and shm id's created (ipcs), run the
script ./cleanup to remove them from your system.

You can manually remove the ids by doing the following

IDS=`ipcs | cut -f 2 -d " "`

ipcrm sem $IDS
ipcrm shm $IDS
ipcrm msg $IDS

The signal tests are not garunteed to work on 64 bit machines.
