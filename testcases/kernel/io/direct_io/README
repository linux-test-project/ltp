The directory consists of following:
	diotest_routines.c:	Routines to support the test programs.
	diotest[1-6].c:		6 test programs with 30 test blocks.
	Makefile:		To compile the programs.

To run the programs:
	1: Compile the programs
		$ make
	2: Execute the test script or the test programs individually.
		$ ./diorun
		Creates a "logfile" by default under current directory.
		For any failures, look in the logfile for more information.

		OR

		$ <testprogram-name> [options]

Note:
-----
1: The script diorun gives different ways to run the tests. Add additional
   test cases as needed.
2: For diotest3.c and diotest6.c fails randomly with a number of children
   for bigger runs. The test fail with either data comparaision failures
   or input/output errors during read. Two issues are identified with
   buffered/direct read, write coherence and the problem is reported.
