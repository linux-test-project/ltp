/* Description: The man page for open(2) states the following:                */
/*   O_DIRECT (Since Linux 2.6.10). Try to minimize cache effects of the I/O  */
/*   to and from this file. In general this will degrade performance, but it  */
/*   is useful in special situations, such as when applications do their own  */
/*   caching. File I/O is done directly to/from user space buffers. The I/O is*/
/*   synchronous, that is, at the completion of a read(2) or write(2), data is*/
/*   guranteed to have been transferred. Under Linux 2.4 transfer sizes, and  */
/*   the alignment of user buffer and file  offset  must all be multiples of  */
/*   the logical block size of the file system.  Under Linux 2.6 alignment to */
/*   512-byte bound-aries suffices.                                           */
/*   However, it appears that data corruption may occur when a multithreaded  */
/*   process reads into a non-page size aligned user buffer. A test program   */
/*   which reliably reproduces the problem on ext3 and xfs is attached. The   */
/*   program creates, patterns, reads, and verify a series of files. In the   */
/*   read phase, a file is opened with O_DIRECT n times, where n is the       */
/*   number of cpu's. A single buffer large enough to contain the file is     */
/*   allocated and patterned with data not found in any of the files. The     */
/*   alignment of the buffer is controlled by a command line option. Each file*/
/*   is read in parallel by n threads, where n is the number of cpu's. Thread */
/*   0 reads the first page of data from the file into the first page of the  */
/*   buffer, thread 1 reads the second page of data in to the second page of  */
/*   the buffer, and so on.  Thread n - 1 reads the remainder of the file into*/
/*   the remainder of the buffer.                                             */
/*   After a thread reads data into the buffer, it immediately verifies that  */
/*   the contents of the buffer are correct. If the buffer contains corrupt   */
/*   data, the thread dumps the data surrounding the corruption and calls     */
/*   abort(). Otherwise, the thread exits.                                    */
/*   Crucially, before the reader threads are dispatched, another thread is   */
/*   started which calls fork()/msleep() in a loop until all reads are compl- */
/*   eted. The child created by fork() does nothing but call exit(0). A comm- */
/*   and line option controls whether the buffer is aligned.  In the case wh- */
/*   ere the buffer is aligned on a page boundary, all is well. In the case   */
/*   where the buffer is aligned on a page + 512 byte offset, corruption is   */
/*   seen frequently.                                                         */
/*   I believe that what is happening is that in the direct IO path, because  */
/*   the user's buffer is not aligned, some user pages are being mapped twice.*/
/*   When a fork() happens in between the calls to map the page, the page will*/
/*   be marked as COW. When the second map happens (via get_user_pages()), a  */
/*   new physical page will be allocated and copied. Thus, there is a race    */
/*   between the completion of the first read from disk (and write to the user*/
/*   page) and get_user_pages() mapping the page for the second time. If the  */
/*   write does not complete before the page is copied, the user will see     */
/*   stale data in the first 512 bytes of this page of their buffer. Indeed,  */
/*   this is corruption most frequently seen. (It's also possible for the race*/
/*   to be lost the other way, so that the last 3584 bytes of the page are    */
/*   stale.)                                                                  */
/*   The attached program (which is a heavily modified version of a program   */
/*   provided by a customer seeing this problem) reliably reproduces the pro- */
/*   blem on any multicore linux machine on both ext3 and xfs, although any   */
/*   filesystem using the generic blockdev_direct_IO() routine is probably    */
/*   vulnerable. I've seen a few threads that mention the potential for this  */
