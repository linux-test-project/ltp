TESTS to check consistency between O_DIRECT reads/writes and buffered
reads/writes and truncate.

These tests should be run from the aiodio directory and MUST use a kernel
compiled with GCC 3.3.X. Older versions of the compiler will fail and seg fault.

The large file passed should be at least 25M to properly stress AIO & DIO. A
suggestion would be a tarred version of the gcc package.

Run the ltp-aiodio.sh file to execute all the tests. The tests can also be run
individually, just execute the program and the excepted params will be output.
No scripts were created to run the test standalone.
