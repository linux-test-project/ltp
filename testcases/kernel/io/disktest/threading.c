* Revision 1.5  2008/02/14 08:22:24  subrata_modak
* Disktest application update to version 1.4.2, by, Brent Yardley <yardleyb@us.ibm.com>
*
* Revision 1.11  2006/04/21 23:10:43  yardleyb
* Major updates for v1_3_3 of disktest.  View README for details.
*
* Revision 1.10  2004/11/20 04:43:42  yardleyb
* Minor code fixes.  Checking for alloc errors.
*
* Revision 1.9  2004/11/19 21:45:12  yardleyb
* Fixed issue with code added for -F option.  Cased disktest
* to SEG FAULT when cleaning up threads.
*
* Revision 1.8  2004/11/02 20:47:13  yardleyb
* Added -F functions.
* lots of minor fixes. see README
*
* Revision 1.7  2002/04/24 01:45:31  yardleyb
* Minor Fixes:
* Read/write time could exceeds overall time
* Heartbeat options sometimes only displayed once
* Cleanup time for large number of threads was very long (windows)
* If heartbeat specified, now checks for performance option also
* No IO was performed when -S0:0 and -pr specified
*
* Revision 1.6  2002/03/30 01:32:14  yardleyb
* Major Changes:
*
* Added Dumping routines for
* data miscompares,
*
* Updated performance output
* based on command line.  Gave
* one decimal in MB/s output.
*
* Rewrote -pL IO routine to show
* correct stats.  Now show pass count
* when using -C.
*
* Minor Changes:
*
* Code cleanup to remove the plethera
* if #ifdef for windows/unix functional
* differences.
*
* Revision 1.5  2002/03/07 03:30:11  yardleyb
* Return errno on thread
* create failure
*
* Revision 1.4  2002/02/28 04:25:45  yardleyb
* reworked threading code
* made locking code a macro.
*
* Revision 1.3  2002/02/19 02:46:37  yardleyb
* Added changes to compile for AIX.
* Update getvsiz so it returns a -1
* if the ioctl fails and we handle
* that fact correctly.  Added check
* to force vsiz to always be greater
* then stop_lba.
*
* Revision 1.2  2002/02/04 20:35:38  yardleyb
* Changed max. number of threads to 64k.
* Check for max threads in parsing.
* Fixed windows getopt to return correctly
* when a bad option is given.
* Update time output to be in the format:
*   YEAR/MONTH/DAY-HOUR:MIN:SEC
* instead of epoch time.
*
* Revision 1.1  2001/12/04 18:51:06  yardleyb
* Checkin of new source files and removal
* of outdated source
*
