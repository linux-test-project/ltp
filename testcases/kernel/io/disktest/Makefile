# Revision 1.13  2009/11/06 20:07:30  vapier
# drop adding of -O/-W type flags that are already handled in common .mk files
#
# for the few makefiles that arent yet converted to the .mk infrastructure:
# Lately gcc developers introduced -Wextra flag that does the same as -W but is
# more descriptive. According to this using -W flag should be safe (as gcc is
# backward compatlible) but using -Wextra is limited to newer gcc releases.
#
# Attached patch replaces all -Wextra occurences with -W and thus fixes
# compliation failures with older gcc (mine was gcc-3.3.3 on sles).
#
# patch by Cyril Hrubis

# 1. Please see README.mk-devel for a full description of the changes
# from a Make perspective.
# 2. Several files were changed to accomodate correct installation
# practices, most notably ones in testcases/network/{ipv6,tcp_cmds},
# testcases/kernel/sched/hyperthreading/ht_enabled/..., and some items
# in tools/..., and also to avoid collisions as far as installed
# testcases (scripts, compiled C apps) were concerned.
# 3. Several apps weren't autoconf safe and some autoconf tests and
# conditional statements have been placed in sourcecode and in Makefiles
# to either a) prevent the tests from being built / installed or b) turn
# the tests into dummy apps which print out TCONF messages due to
# lack-of-build support.

# 1. -D_LARGE_FILES is used in AIX to support 64bit functions and data types.
# 2. For Linux:
#     i.  -D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 is used in to support
#         64-bit functions and data types.
#     ii. -D_GNU_SOURCE is to support Linux O_DIRECT.
#
#    i. and ii. are typically taken from rpm, but, if not, are defined here.
