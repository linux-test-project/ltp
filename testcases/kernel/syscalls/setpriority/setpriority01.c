/*
 * NAME
 *	setpriority01.c
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *	setpriority01 - set the priority for the test process lower.
 *
 * CALLS
 *	setpriority()
 *
 * ALGORITHM
 *	loop if that option was specified
 *	issue the system call
 *	read back the priority with getpriority()
 *	check the errno value
 *	  if errno == 0 and the new priority == the set priority
 *	  then issue a PASS message
 *	otherwise, the tests fails
 *	  issue a FAIL message
 *	  break any remaining tests
 *	  call cleanup
 *
 * USAGE:  <for command-line>
 *  setpriority01 [-c n] [-f] [-i n] [-I x] [-p x] [-t]
 *     where,  -c n : Run n copies concurrently.
 *             -f   : Turn off functionality Testing.
 *	       -i n : Execute test n times.
 *	       -I x : Execute test for x seconds.
 *	       -P x : Pause for x seconds between iterations.
 *	       -t   : Turn on syscall timing.
