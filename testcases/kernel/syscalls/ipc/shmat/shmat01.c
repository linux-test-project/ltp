/*
 * NAME
 *	shmat01.c
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *	shmat01 - test that shmat() works correctly
 *
 * ALGORITHM
 *	create a shared memory resouce with read/write permissions
 *	loop if that option was specified
 *	call shmat() with the TEST() macro using three valid conditions
 *	check the return code
 *	  if failure, issue a FAIL message.
 *	otherwise,
 *	  if doing functionality testing
 *		check for the correct conditions after the call
 *	  	if correct,
 *			issue a PASS message
 *		otherwise
 *			issue a FAIL message
 *	call cleanup
 *
 * USAGE:  <for command-line>
 *  shmat01 [-c n] [-f] [-i n] [-I x] [-P x] [-t]
 *     where,  -c n : Run n copies concurrently.
 *             -f   : Turn off functionality Testing.
 *	       -i n : Execute test n times.
 *	       -I x : Execute test for x seconds.
 *	       -P x : Pause for x seconds between iterations.
 *	       -t   : Turn on syscall timing.
 *
 * HISTORY
 *	03/2001 - Written by Wayne Boyer
