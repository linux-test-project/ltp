/*
 * NAME
 *	shmget03.c
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *	shmget03 - test for ENOSPC error
 *
 * ALGORITHM
 *	create shared memory segments in a loop until reaching the system limit
 *	loop if that option was specified
 *	  attempt to create yet another shared memory segment
 *	  check the errno value
 *	    issue a PASS message if we get ENOSPC
 *	  otherwise, the tests fails
 *	    issue a FAIL message
 *	call cleanup
 *
 * USAGE:  <for command-line>
 *  shmget03 [-c n] [-e] [-i n] [-I x] [-P x] [-t]
 *     where,  -c n : Run n copies concurrently.
 *             -e   : Turn on errno logging.
 *	       -i n : Execute test n times.
 *	       -I x : Execute test for x seconds.
 *	       -P x : Pause for x seconds between iterations.
 *	       -t   : Turn on syscall timing.
 *
 * HISTORY
 *	03/2001 - Written by Wayne Boyer

 * RESTRICTIONS
 *	none
