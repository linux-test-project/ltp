/*
 * NAME
 *	msgctl03.c
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *	msgctl03 - create a message queue, then issue the IPC_RMID command
 *
 * ALGORITHM
 *	create a message queue
 *	loop if that option was specified
 *	call msgctl() with the IPC_RMID command
 *	check the return code
 *	  if failure, issue a FAIL message and break remaining tests
 *	otherwise,
 *	  if doing functionality testing
 *		issue an IPC_STAT on the queue that was just removed
 *	  	if the call fails
 *			issue a PASS message
 *		otherwise
 *			issue a FAIL message
 *	  else issue a PASS message
 *	call cleanup
 *
 * USAGE:  <for command-line>
 *  msgctl03 [-c n] [-f] [-I x] [-P x] [-t]
 *     where,  -c n : Run n copies concurrently.
 *             -f   : Turn off functionality Testing.
 *	       -I x : Execute test for x seconds.
 *	       -P x : Pause for x seconds between iterations.
 *	       -t   : Turn on syscall timing.
 *
 * HISTORY
 *	03/2001 - Written by Wayne Boyer
 *
 * RESTRICTIONS
 *	This test does not support looping.
