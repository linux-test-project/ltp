/*
 * Test Name: pread01
 *
 * Test Description:
 *  Verify the functionality of pread() by writing known data using pwrite()
 *  to the file at various specified offsets and later read from the file from
 *  various specified offsets, comparing the data read aganist the data
 *  written.
 *
 * Expected Result:
 *  pread() should succeed to read the expected no. of bytes of data and
 *  the data read should match aganist the data written to the file.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *  Setup:
 *   Setup signal handling.
 *   Create temporary directory.
 *   Pause for SIGUSR1 if option specified.
 *
 *  Test:
 *   Loop if the proper options are given.
 *   Execute system call
 *   Check return code, if system call failed (return=-1)
 *      Issue a FAIL message.
 *   Otherwise,
 *      Verify the Functionality of system call
 *      if successful,
 *          Issue Functionality-Pass message.
 *      Otherwise,
 *          Issue Functionality-Fail message.
 *  Cleanup:
 *   Print errno log and/or timing stats if options given
 *   Delete the temporary directory created.
 *
 * Usage:  <for command-line>
 *  pread01 [-c n] [-f] [-i n] [-I x] [-P x] [-t]
 *     where,  -c n : Run n copies concurrently.
 *             -f   : Turn off functionality Testing.
 *             -i n : Execute test n times.
 *             -I x : Execute test for x seconds.
 *             -P x : Pause for x seconds between iterations.
 *             -t   : Turn on syscall timing.
