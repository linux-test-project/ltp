 * Test:        epoll_create1_01.c
 *
 * Description: This Program tests the new system call introduced in 2.6.27.
 *              UlrichÂ´s comment as in:
 * http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=a0998b50c3f0b8fdd265c63e0032f86ebe377dbf
 *
 * This patch adds the new epoll_create1 syscall.  It extends the old
 * epoll_create syscall by one parameter which is meant to hold a flag value.
 * In this patch the only flag support is EPOLL_CLOEXEC which causes the
 * close-on-exec flag for the returned file descriptor to be set. A new name
 * EPOLL_CLOEXEC is introduced which in this implementation must have the same
 * value as O_CLOEXEC.
