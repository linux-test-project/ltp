/*
 * Test Name: alarm05
 *
 * Test Description:
 *  Check the functionality of the Alarm system call when the time input
 *  parameter is non zero.
 *
 * Expected Result:
 *  The return value of the alarm system call should be equal to the
 *  amount previously remaining in the alarm clock.
 *  A SIGALRM signal should be received after the specified amount of
 *  time has elapsed.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *  Setup:
 *   Setup signal handling.
 *   Pause for SIGUSR1 if option specified.
 *
 *  Test:
 *   Loop if the proper options are given.
 *   Execute system call
 *   Check return code, if system call failed (return=-1)
 *   	Log the errno and Issue a FAIL message.
 *   Otherwise,
 *   	Verify the Functionality of system call
 *      if successful,
 *      	Issue Functionality-Pass message.
 *      Otherwise,
 *		Issue Functionality-Fail message.
 *  Cleanup:
 *   Print errno log and/or timing stats if options given
 *
 * Usage:  <for command-line>
 *  alarm05 [-c n] [-f] [-i n] [-I x] [-P x] [-t]
 *     where,  -c n : Run n copies concurrently.
 *             -f   : Turn off functionality Testing.
 *	       -i n : Execute test n times.
 *	       -I x : Execute test for x seconds.
 *	       -P x : Pause for x seconds between iterations.
 *	       -t   : Turn on syscall timing.
 *

 *	06/2005 Test for alarm cleanup by Amos Waterland
 *	07/2001 Ported by Wayne Boyer
 *
 * RESTRICTIONS:
 *  None.
