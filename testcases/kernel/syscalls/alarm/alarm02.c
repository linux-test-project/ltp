 *    TEST TITLE        : Boundary Value Test for alarm(2)
 *
 *    PARENT DOCUMENT   : almtds02

 *    TEST CASE TOTAL   : 3
 *
 *    WALL CLOCK TIME   : 1
 *
 *    CPU TYPES         : ALL
 *
 *    AUTHOR            : Billy Jean Horne
 *
 *    CO-PILOT          : Kathy Olmsted
 *
 *    DATE STARTED      : 06/01/92
 *
 *    INITIAL RELEASE   : UNICOS 7.0
 *
 *    TEST CASES
 *      Test Case One - A call to alarm() shall not return an error if
 *       seconds is a -1.
 *       Test FAILS if a non-zero value is returned.
 *      Test Case Two - A call to alarm() shall not return an error if
 *       seconds is the maximum unsigned integer (2**63).
 *       Test FAILS if a non-zero value is returned.
 *      Test Case Three - A call to alarm() shall not return an error if
 *       seconds is the maximum unsigned integer plus 1 ((2**63)+1).
 *       Test FAILS if a non-zero value is returned.
 *
 *    ENVIRONMENTAL NEEDS
 *      The libcuts.a and libsys.a libraries must be included in
 *      the compilation of this test.
 *
 *    DETAILED DESCRIPTION
 *
 *      Setup:
 *        Define a cleanup function.
 *
 *      Test:
 *       Loop for each test case.
 *        Execute alarm (0) system call to clear previous alarm.
 *        Check return code, if system call failed (return=-1)
 *           Issue a FAIL message and exit the test.
 *        Call alarm() with boundary values for seconds.
 *        Verify that returned value is as expected.
 *        Report results.
 *
 *      Cleanup:
