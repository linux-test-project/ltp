/*
 * Test Name: pwrite01
 *
 * Test Description:
 *  Verify the functionality of pwrite() by writing known data using pwrite()
 *  to the file at various specified offsets and later read from the file from
 *  various specified offsets, comparing the data written aganist the data
 *  read using read().
 *
 * Expected Result:
 *  pwrite() should succeed to write the expected no. of bytes of data and
 *  the data written at specified offsets should match aganist the data read
 *  from that offset.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *  Setup:
 *   Setup signal handling.
 *   Create temporary directory.
 *   Pause for SIGUSR1 if option specified.
 *
 *  Test:
 *   Loop if the proper options are given.
 *   Execute system call
 *   Check return code, if system call failed (return=-1)
 *   	Log the errno and Issue a FAIL message.
 *   Otherwise,
 *   	Verify the Functionality of system call
 *      if successful,
 *      	Issue Functionality-Pass message.
 *      Otherwise,
 *		Issue Functionality-Fail message.
 *  Cleanup:
 *   Print errno log and/or timing stats if options given
 *   Delete the temporary directory created.
 *
 * Usage:  <for command-line>
 *  pwrite01 [-c n] [-f] [-i n] [-I x] [-P x] [-t]
 *     where,  -c n : Run n copies concurrently.
 *             -f   : Turn off functionality Testing.
 *	       -i n : Execute test n times.
 *	       -I x : Execute test for x seconds.
 *	       -P x : Pause for x seconds between iterations.
 *	       -t   : Turn on syscall timing.
