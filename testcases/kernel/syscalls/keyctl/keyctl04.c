/*
 * Regression test for commit c9f838d104fe ("KEYS: fix
 * keyctl_set_reqkey_keyring() to not leak thread keyrings"), a.k.a.
 * CVE-2017-7472.  This bug could be used to exhaust kernel memory, though it
 * would take a while to do that and it would grind the test suite to a halt.
 * Instead we do a quick check for whether the existing thread keyring is
 * replaced when the default request-key destination is set to the thread
 * keyring.  It shouldn't be, but before the fix it was (and the old thread
 * keyring was leaked).
