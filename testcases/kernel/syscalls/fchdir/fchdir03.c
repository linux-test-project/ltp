/*
 * DESCRIPTION
 *	Testcase for testing that fchdir(2) sets EACCES errno
 *
 * ALGORITHM
 *	1.	create a child process, sets its uid to ltpuser1
 *	2.	this child creates a directory with perm 400,
 *	3.	this child opens the directory and gets a file descriptor
 *	4.	this child attempts to fchdir(2) to the directory created in 2.
 *		and expects to get an EACCES.
