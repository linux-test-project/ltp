/*
 * NAME
 *	personality02.c
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *	personality02 - Check that we don't get EINVAL for a bad personality.
 *
 * CALLS
 *	personality()
 *
 * ALGORITHM
 *	loop if that option was specified
 *	issue the system call
 *	check the errno value
 *	  issue a FAIL message if we get EINVAL
 *	otherwise, the tests passes
 *	  issue a PASS message
 *	  call cleanup
 *
 * USAGE:  <for command-line>
 *  personality02 [-c n] [-e] [-i n] [-I x] [-P x] [-t]
 *     where,  -c n : Run n copies concurrently.
 *             -e   : Turn on errno logging.
 *	       -i n : Execute test n times.
 *	       -I x : Execute test for x seconds.
 *	       -P x : Pause for x seconds between iterations.
 *	       -t   : Turn on syscall timing.
 *
 * HISTORY
 *	03/2001 - Written by Wayne Boyer
 *	02/2003 - inverted by Paul Larson
 *		  It appears that personality() should NEVER return
 *		  EINVAL unless something went horribly wrong. Changed
 *		  the test to reflect this behaviour.
 *
 * RESTRICTIONS
 *	none
 *
 * NOTES
 *	It appears that the personality() call will always be
 *	successful with the way it is implemented in the kernel.
 *	This behavior differs from that described in the man page.
