/*
 * Test Name: mmap01
 *
 * Test Description:
 *  Verify that, mmap() succeeds when used to map a file where size of the
 *  file is not a multiple of the page size, the memory area beyond the end
 *  of the file to the end of the page is accessible. Also, verify that
 *  this area is all zeroed and the modifications done to this area are
 *  not written to the file.
 *
 * Expected Result:
 *  mmap() should succeed returning the address of the mapped region.
 *  The memory area beyond the end of file to the end of page should be
 *  filled with zero.
 *  The changes beyond the end of file should not get written to the file.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *  Setup:
 *   Setup signal handling.
 *   Pause for SIGUSR1 if option specified.
 *   Create temporary directory.
 *
 *  Test:
 *   Loop if the proper options are given.
 *   Execute system call
 *   Check return code, if system call failed (return=-1)
 *	Log the errno and Issue a FAIL message.
 *   Otherwise,
 *	Verify the Functionality of system call
 *      if successful,
 *		Issue Functionality-Pass message.
 *      Otherwise,
 *		Issue Functionality-Fail message.
 *  Cleanup:
 *   Print timing stats if options given
 *   Delete the temporary directory created.
 *
 * Usage:  <for command-line>
 *  mmap01 [-c n] [-f] [-i n] [-I x] [-P x] [-t]
 *     where,  -c n : Run n copies concurrently.
 *             -f   : Turn off functionality Testing.
 *	       -i n : Execute test n times.
 *	       -I x : Execute test for x seconds.
 *	       -P x : Pause for x seconds between iterations.
 *	       -t   : Turn on syscall timing.
