/*
 * Regression test for commit ea6789980fda ("assoc_array: Fix a buggy
 * node-splitting case"), or CVE-2017-12193.
 *
 * Reproducing this bug requires adding keys to a keyring in a certain way that
 * triggers a corner case in the kernel's "associative array" implementation,
 * which is the data structure used to hold keys in a keyring, indexed by type
 * and description.
 *
 * Specifically, the root node of a keyring's associative array must be
 * completely filled with keys that all cluster together within the same slot.
 * Then a key must be added which goes in a different slot.  On broken kernels,
 * this caused a NULL pointer dereference in assoc_array_apply_edit().
 *
 * This can be done by carefully crafting key descriptions.  However, an easier
 * way is to just add 16 keyrings and then a non-keyring, since keyrings all go
 * into their own top-level slot.  This test takes the easier approach.
