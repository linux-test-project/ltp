/*
 * Test that the add_key() syscall correctly handles a NULL payload with nonzero
 * length.  Specifically, it should fail with EFAULT rather than oopsing the
 * kernel with a NULL pointer dereference or failing with EINVAL, as it did
 * before (depending on the key type).  This is a regression test for commit
 * 5649645d725c ("KEYS: fix dereferencing NULL payload with nonzero length").
 *
 * Note that none of the key types that exhibited the NULL pointer dereference
 * are guaranteed to be built into the kernel, so we just test as many as we
 * can, in the hope of catching one.  We also test with the "user" key type for
 * good measure, although it was one of the types that failed with EINVAL rather
 * than dereferencing NULL.
 *
 * This has been assigned CVE-2017-15274.
