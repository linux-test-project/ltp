/*
 * Test Name: mremap04
 *
 * Test Description:
 *  Verify that,
 *   mremap() fails when used to expand the existing virtual memory mapped
 *   region to the requested size, if the memory area cannot be expanded at
 *   the current virtual address and MREMAP_MAYMOVE flag not set.
 *
 * Expected Result:
 *  mremap() should return -1 and set errno to ENOMEM.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *  Setup:
 *   Setup signal handling.
 *   Create temporary directory.
 *   Pause for SIGUSR1 if option specified.
 *
 *  Test:
 *   Loop if the proper options are given.
 *   Execute system call
 *   Check return code, if system call failed (return=-1)
 *	if errno set == expected errno
 *		Issue sys call failed with expected return value and errno.
 *	Otherwise,
 *		Issue sys call failed with unexpected errno.
 *   Otherwise,
 *	Issue sys call returns unexpected value.
 *
 *  Cleanup:
 *   Print errno log and/or timing stats if options given
 *   Delete the temporary directory(s)/file(s) created.
 *
 * Usage:  <for command-line>
 *  mremap04 [-c n] [-e] [-i n] [-I x] [-P x] [-t]
 *     where,  -c n : Run n copies concurrently.
 *             -e   : Turn on errno logging.
 *	       -i n : Execute test n times.
 *	       -I x : Execute test for x seconds.
 *	       -p x : Pause for x seconds between iterations.
 *	       -t   : Turn on syscall timing.

 *
 *      11/09/2001 Manoj Iyer (manjo@austin.ibm.com)
 *      Modified.
 *      - #include <linux/mman.h> should not be included as per man page for
 *        mremap, #include <sys/mman.h> alone should do the job. But inorder
 *        to include definition of MREMAP_MAYMOVE defined in bits/mman.h
 *        (included by sys/mman.h) __USE_GNU needs to be defined.
 *        There may be a more elegant way of doing this...
 *
 *      26/02/2008 Renaud Lottiaux (Renaud.Lottiaux@kerlabs.com)
 *      - Fix concurrency issue. Use a shm key from getipckey instead of
 *        a fixed hard-coded value.
 *
 * RESTRICTIONS:
 *  None.
