/*
 * NAME
 *	write02.c
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *	Basic functionality test: does the return from write match the count
 *	of the number of bytes written.
 *
 *
 * ALGORITHM
 *	Create a file and write some bytes out to it.
 *	Check the return count against the number returned.
 *
 * USAGE:  <for command-line>
 *      write02 [-c n] [-e] [-i n] [-I x] [-P x] [-t]
 *      where,  -c n : Run n copies concurrently.
 *              -e   : Turn on errno logging.
 *              -i n : Execute test n times.
 *              -I x : Execute test for x seconds.
 *              -P x : Pause for x seconds between iterations.
 *              -t   : Turn on syscall timing.
 *
 * History
