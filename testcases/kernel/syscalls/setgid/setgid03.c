 * NAME
 * 	setgid03.c
 *
 * CALLS
 * 	setgid(1) getgid(2)
 *
 * ALGORITHM
 * 	As root sets the current group id to ltpuser1, verify the results
 *
 * USAGE:  <for command-line>
 *  setgid03 [-c n] [-f] [-i n] [-I x] [-P x] [-t]
 *     where,  -c n : Run n copies concurrently.
 *             -f   : Turn off functionality Testing.
 *             -i n : Execute test n times.
 *             -I x : Execute test for x seconds.
 *             -P x : Pause for x seconds between iterations.
 *             -t   : Turn on syscall timing.
