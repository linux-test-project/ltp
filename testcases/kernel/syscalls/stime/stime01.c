/*
 * Test Name: stime01
 *
 * Test Description:
 *  Verify that the system call stime() successfully sets the system's idea
 *  of date and time if invoked by "root" user.
 *
 * Expected Result:
 *  stime() should succeed to set the system data/time to the specified time.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *  Setup:
 *   Setup signal handling.
 *   Pause for SIGUSR1 if option specified.
 *
 *  Test:
 *   Loop if the proper options are given.
 *   Execute system call
 *   Check return code, if system call failed (return=-1)
 *   	Log the errno and Issue a FAIL message.
 *   Otherwise,
 *   	Verify the Functionality of system call
 *      if successful,
 *      	Issue Functionality-Pass message.
 *      Otherwise,
 *		Issue Functionality-Fail message.
 *  Cleanup:
 *   Print errno log and/or timing stats if options given
 *
 * Usage:  <for command-line>
 *  stime01 [-c n] [-e] [-f] [-i n] [-I x] [-p x] [-t]
 *	where,  -c n : Run n copies concurrently.
 *		-e   : Turn on errno logging.
 *		-f   : Turn off functionality Testing.
 *		-i n : Execute test n times.
 *		-I x : Execute test for x seconds.
 *		-P x : Pause for x seconds between iterations.
 *		-t   : Turn on syscall timing.
 *
 * History
 *	07/2001 John George
 *		-Ported
 *
 * Restrictions:
 *  This test should be run by 'super-user' (root) only.
