/*
 * DESCRIPTION
 *	Testcase for testing that chdir(2) sets EACCES errno
 *
 * ALGORITHM
 *	1.	running as root, create a directory with perm 700
 *	2.	create a child process, sets its uid to nobody
 *	3.	this child attempts to chdir(2) to the directory created in 1
 *		and expects to get an EACCES.
