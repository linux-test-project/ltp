/*
 * Regression test for two related bugs:
 *
 * (1) CVE-2017-15299, fixed by commit 60ff5b2f547a ("KEYS: don't let add_key()
 *     update an uninstantiated key")
 * (2) CVE-2017-15951, fixed by commit 363b02dab09b ("KEYS: Fix race between
 *     updating and finding a negative key")
 *
 * We test for the bugs together because the reproduction steps are essentially
 * the same: repeatedly try to add/update a key with add_key() while requesting
 * it with request_key() in another task.  This reproduces both bugs:
 *
 * For CVE-2017-15299, add_key() has to run while the key being created by
 * request_key() is still in the "uninstantiated" state.  For the "encrypted" or
 * "trusted" key types (not guaranteed to be available) this caused a NULL
 * pointer dereference in encrypted_update() or in trusted_update(),
 * respectively.  For the "user" key type, this caused the WARN_ON() in
 * construct_key() to be hit.
 *
 * For CVE-2017-15951, request_key() has to run while the key is "negatively
 * instantiated" (from a prior request_key()) and is being concurrently changed
 * to "positively instantiated" via add_key() updating it.  This race, which is
 * a bit more difficult to reproduce, caused the task executing request_key() to
 * dereference an invalid pointer in __key_link_begin().
