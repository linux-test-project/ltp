/*
 * DESCRIPTION
 *	Open a file with oflag = O_CREAT set, does it set the sticky bit off?
 *	Open a dir with O_DIRECTORY, does it set the S_IFDIR bit on?
 *
 * ALGORITHM
 *	1. open a new file with O_CREAT, fstat.st_mode should not have the
 *	   01000 bit on. In Linux, the save text bit is *NOT* cleared.
 *	2. open a new dir with O_DIRECTORY, fstat.st_mode should have the
 *	   040000 bit on.
