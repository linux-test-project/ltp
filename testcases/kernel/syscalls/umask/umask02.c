/*
 * NAME
 *	umask02.c
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *	Check that umask changes the mask, and that the previous
 *	value of the mask is returned correctly for each value.
 *
 * ALGORITHM
 *	For each mask value (9 bits) set mask, and check that the return
 *	corresponds to the previous value set.
 *
 * USAGE:  <for command-line>
 *	umask02 [-c n] [-e] [-i n] [-I x] [-P x] [-t]
 *	where,  -c n : Run n copies concurrently.
 *		-e   : Turn on errno logging.
 *		-i n : Execute test n times.
 *		-I x : Execute test for x seconds.
 *		-P x : Pause for x seconds between iterations.
 *		-t   : Turn on syscall timing.
 *
 * History
 *	07/2001 John George
 *		-Ported
 *
 * Restrictions
 *	None
