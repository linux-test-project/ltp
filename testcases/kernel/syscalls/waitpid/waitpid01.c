/*
 * NAME
 *	waitpid01.c
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *	Check that when a child kills itself by generating an alarm
 *	exception, the waiting parent is correctly notified.
 *
 * ALGORITHM
 *	Fork a child that sets an alarm. When the alarm goes off, causing
 *	the death of the child, the parent checks that SIG_ALRM was returned
 *
 * USAGE:  <for command-line>
 *      waitpid01 [-c n] [-i n] [-I x] [-P x] [-t]
 *      where,  -c n : Run n copies concurrently.
 *              -i n : Execute test n times.
 *              -I x : Execute test for x seconds.
 *              -P x : Pause for x seconds between iterations.
 *              -t   : Turn on syscall timing.
 *
 * History
 *	07/2001 John George
