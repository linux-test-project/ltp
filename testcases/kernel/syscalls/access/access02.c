/*
 * Test Description:
 *  Verify that access() succeeds to check the existence or read/write/execute
 *  permissions on a file if the mode argument passed was F_OK/R_OK/W_OK/X_OK.
 *
 *  Also verify that, access() succeeds to test the accessibility of the file
 *  referred to by symbolic link if the pathname points to a symbolic link.
 *
 *  As well as verify that, these test files can be
 *  stat/read/written/executed indeed as root and nobody respectively.
