/*
 * NAME
 *	pipe01.c
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *	Testcase to check the basic functionality of the pipe(2) syscall:
 *	Check that both ends of the pipe (both file descriptors) are
 *	available to a process opening the pipe.
 *
 * ALGORITHM
 *	Write a string of characters down a pipe; read the string from the
 *	other file descriptor. Test passes if both can be done, as reported
 *	by the number of characters written and read.
 *
 * USAGE:  <for command-line>
 *  pipe01 [-c n] [-f] [-i n] [-I x] [-P x] [-t]
 *     where,  -c n : Run n copies concurrently.
 *             -f   : Turn off functionality Testing.
 *             -i n : Execute test n times.
 *             -I x : Execute test for x seconds.
 *             -P x : Pause for x seconds between iterations.
 *             -t   : Turn on syscall timing.
 *
 * RESTRICITONS
 *	NONE
