/*
 * NAME
 *	pipe09.c
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *	Check that two processes can use the same pipe at the same time.
 *
 * ALGORITHM
 *	1. Open a  pipe
 *	2. Fork a child which writes to the pipe
 *	3. Fork another child which writes a different character to the pipe
 *	4. Have the parent read from the pipe
 *	5. It should get the characters from both children.
 *
 * USAGE:  <for command-line>
 *  pipe09 [-c n] [-f] [-i n] [-I x] [-P x] [-t]
 *     where,  -c n : Run n copies concurrently.
 *             -f   : Turn off functionality Testing.
 *             -i n : Execute test n times.
 *             -I x : Execute test for x seconds.
 *             -P x : Pause for x seconds between iterations.
 *             -t   : Turn on syscall timing.
