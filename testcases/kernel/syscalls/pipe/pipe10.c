/*
 * NAME
 *	pipe10.c
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *	Check that parent can open a pipe and have a child read from it
 *
 * ALGORITHM
 *	Parent opens pipe, child reads. Passes if child can read all the
 *	characters written by the parent.
 *
 * USAGE:  <for command-line>
 *  pipe10 [-c n] [-f] [-i n] [-I x] [-P x] [-t]
 *     where,  -c n : Run n copies concurrently.
 *             -f   : Turn off functionality Testing.
 *             -i n : Execute test n times.
 *             -I x : Execute test for x seconds.
 *             -P x : Pause for x seconds between iterations.
 *             -t   : Turn on syscall timing.
 *
 * HISTORY
 *	07/2001 Ported by Wayne Boyer
