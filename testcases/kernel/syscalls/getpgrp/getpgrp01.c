 *
 *    INPUT SPECIFICATIONS
 * 	The standard options for system call tests are accepted.

 *
 *    OUTPUT SPECIFICATIONS
 *$
 *    DURATION
 * 	Terminates - with frequency and infinite modes.
 *
 *    SIGNALS
 * 	Uses SIGUSR1 to pause before test if option set.

 *
 *    DETAILED DESCRIPTION
 *	This is a Phase I test for the getpgrp(2) system call.  It is intended
 *	to provide a limited exposure of the system call, for now.  It
 *	should/will be extended when full functional tests are written for
 *	getpgrp(2).
 *
 * 	Setup:
 * 	  Setup signal handling.
 *	  Pause for SIGUSR1 if option specified.
 *
 * 	Test:
 *	 Loop if the proper options are given.
 * 	  Execute system call
 *	  Check return code, if system call failed (return=-1)
 *		Log the errno and Issue a FAIL message.
 *	  Otherwise, Issue a PASS message.
 *
 * 	Cleanup:
 * 	  Print errno log and/or timing stats if options given
 *
