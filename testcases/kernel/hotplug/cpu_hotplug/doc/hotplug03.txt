Testcase 03
-----------

This test verifies that when you online a new CPU, that the scheduler
takes advantage of it by shifting some of its workloads onto it.  We do
this by offlining a CPU, creating a bunch of processor intensive
processes, and then onlining the CPU, and checking to make sure at least
one of the processes moved to that CPU.


Algorithm
=========
Given a CPU to test that exists

Take a snapshot of what CPUs are on and off initially

Loop until done:
  Online all of the CPUs and note their state

  Offline the specified CPU

  Start up a number of processes equal to twice the number of CPUs we
  have, so we can be pretty sure that we've got enough processes that at
  least one will migrate to the new CPU.

  Now online the specified CPU

  Wait a few seconds, to allow the process scheduler to move processes
  around a bit.

  Verify that at least one process has migrated to the new CPU by
  looking at the output from 'ps -o psr -o com' and searching for our
  CPU running the process.


When exiting:
  Kill all of the load processes

  Restore all CPUs to their initial state
