Testcase 02
-----------

This test checks that a process migrates when the CPU it is running on
is offlined.


Algorithm
=========
Given a CPU to test that exists

Make sure the cpu is online

Start a process that just uses processor cycles

Loop until done:
  Move the process to the CPU we will be offlining

  Offline the CPU

  Determine which CPU the process migrated to

  Verify that it is still running

  Verify that it is not running on the original CPU

  Turn the CPU back online



When exiting:
  Kill the spin loop process
