Linux Hotplug CPU Support (LHCS) Testsuite
------------------------------------------

This package is a collection of test cases for validating CPU hotplug
capabilities in Linux.

To use this test suite, simply install it someplace on the system to be
tested and then invoke the test suite as root:

     # ./runtests.sh


For details about the test cases, see the doc/ directory.  These tests
exercise the system in ways that have been known to reveal bugs in the
past.

No compilation or installation is required to use this test suite; it
can be run in place using the above script.



About Hotplug CPU
=================
The logic used to operate the hotplug features in Linux are implemented
in the file includes/hotplug.fns.  These include functions for onlining
and offlining CPUs, determining if a given CPU is valid and/or online,
getting lists of CPUs that are available, online, and offline, and
managing IRQ's and affinities as they relate to CPUs.


About the Test Suite
====================
See includes/testsuite.fns for some general purpose routines for
implementing a test suite.  These include process management, timing,
and interupt handling and cleanup.
