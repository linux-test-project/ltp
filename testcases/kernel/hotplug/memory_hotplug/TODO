memtoy:

if migrate_pages(2) system call ever becomes standard, will need to change
Makefile not to build and link against migrate_pages.o and not to define
_NEED_MIGRATE_PAGES.

More documentation?


Desired features?

	+ verify contents after migration?

	+ cpu affinity for testing default policy and migration

	+ set_mempolicy() UI

	+ multiple processes [children] sharing mappings

	+ help summary for help w/ no args.  Details when
	  command specified.

	+ command to toggle verbosity?

	+ echo command to echo comments for scripts

	+ fancier UI [command line editing?]

	+ ...
