/*
 * The program is designed to test max_map_count tunable file
 *
 * The kernel Documentation say that:
 * /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count contains the maximum number of memory map
 * areas a process may have. Memory map areas are used as a side-effect
 * of calling malloc, directly by mmap and mprotect, and also when
 * loading shared libraries.
 *
 * Each process has his own maps file: /proc/[pid]/maps, and each line
 * indicates a map entry, so it can caculate the amount of maps by reading
 * the file lines' number to check the tunable performance.
 *
 * The program tries to invoke mmap() endlessly until it triggers MAP_FAILED,
 * then reads the process's maps file /proc/[pid]/maps, save the line number to
 * map_count variable, and compare it with /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count,
 * map_count should be greater than max_map_count by 1;
 *
 * Note: On some architectures there is a special vma VSYSCALL, which
 * is allocated without incrementing mm->map_count variable. On these
 * architectures each /proc/<pid>/maps has at the end:
 * ...
 * ...
 * ffffffffff600000-ffffffffff601000 r-xp 00000000 00:00 0   [vsyscall]
 *
 * so we ignore this line during /proc/[pid]/maps reading.

	 *        CommitLimit - Committed_AS
	 *    and set overcommit_memory to 2, this could help mapping
	 *    returns ENOMEM instead of triggering oom-killer when
	 *    memory is tight. (When there are enough free memory,
