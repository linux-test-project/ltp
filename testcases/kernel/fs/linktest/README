Overview:
    Name:           linktest.pl
    Description:    A regression test for links per file.
                    Linktest.pl is a simple test that attempts
                    to create a given number of hard links and
                    symbolic links to a single file.

Files:

Availability:
    Currently only available via internal IBM websites pending
    legal review:
    http://cvs.opensource.ibm.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/testcases/fs/fs_perms/?cvsroot=ltp

Installation:
    N/A

Use:
    ./linktest.pl <number of symbolic links> <number of hard links>

    ex:  ./linktest.pl 1000 1000 would create 1000 symlinks and 1000
         hardlinks

Warning(s):
    If execution is terminated, the hlink and slink subdirectories will
    have to be manually removed (along with any links or files in them).

ToDo:
    I'll think of something.
