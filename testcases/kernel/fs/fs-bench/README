Programs for File system stress test.

All of programs are distributed under GPL 2 license

HOW TO TEST
------------

1: Type "make"

	# cd
	# tar zxvf fs-bench.tar.gz
	# cd fs-bench
	# make

2: Change directory to terget file system and do-it!
	(I always use one-HDD/one-partition for fs stress test.)

	# mount -t jfs /dev/hdc1 /jfs
	# cd /jfs
	# ~/fs-bench/test.sh 2>&1 | tee ~/fs-bench/jfs-test


NOTE
-----

The size of files that are created for stress test is not fixed.  The
file size are determined by probabilistic algorithm, box-muler
algorithm.
