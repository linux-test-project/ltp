#To run this script the following is necessary
# 1.kernel should mtd support as module.
# 2.kernel should hsve jffs2 support as module.
# 3.kernel should have loopback device support .
# 4.you should have fs-bench utility (http://h2np.net/tools/fs-bench-0.2.tar.gz)
# 5.results will be copied to /tmp/log and /tmp/log1 files

#DESCRIPTION: This testscript creates a jffs2 file system type and tests the filesytem test
#and places the log in the log directory.The file system test actually creates a tree of large
#directories and performs the delete and random delete operations as per the filesystem stress
#algorithim and gives a report of real time ,user time,system time taken to perform the file
#operations.
