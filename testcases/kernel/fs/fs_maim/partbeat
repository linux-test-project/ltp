#  DESCRIPTION : Quick test to test storage management functions like mount and fsck.
#                More can be added later without much trouble.  Command line takes the
#                partition device name (ex: /dev/hda1), an integer for how many iterations
#                of the test you would like to run and the filesystem type to use (jfs or ext2 for now).
