/*
 *  FILE        : lftest.c
 *  DESCRIPTION : The purpose of this test is to verify the file size limitations of a filesystem.
 *                It writes one buffer at a time and lseeks from the beginning of the file to the
 *                end of the last write position.  The intent is to test lseek64.
 *  HISTORY:
 *           06/19/01  :  Written by Jeff Martin(martinjn@us.ibm.com) to test large files on jfs.
 *           07/12/01  :  Added timing.
