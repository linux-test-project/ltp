Consider replacing long invocations
	(replace "$FS_BIND_ROOT/bin/makedir") with something shorter).

Factor out common bits of setup, setupnslock, and lockfile

Rename smount to something more meaningful? (bind_mount ?)

Check for leaks of vfsmount structs by diffing vfs slab cache obj numbers
	(after -before)

The cloneNS testcases need to be checked and tested -- consider them expiremental. (at least as of March 2008)
