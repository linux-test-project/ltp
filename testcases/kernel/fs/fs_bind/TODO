Reuse http://ltp.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/ltp/ltp/testcases/kernel/containers/check_for_unshare.c to test for unshare (used in nsclone.c) ??

Consider replacing long invocations
	(replace "$FS_BIND_ROOT/bin/makedir") with something shorter).

Factor out common bits of setup, setupnslock, and lockfile

Rename smount to something more meaningful? (bind_mount ?)

Check for leaks of vfsmount structs by diffing vfs slab cache obj numbers
	(after -before)

The cloneNS testcases need to be checked and tested -- consider them expiremental. (at least as of March 2008)
