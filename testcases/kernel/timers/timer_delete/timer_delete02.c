 *    TEST IDENTIFIER	: timer_delete02
 *
 *    EXECUTED BY	: anyone
 *
 *    TEST TITLE	: Basic test for timer_delete(2)
 *
 *    TEST CASE TOTAL	: 1
 *
 *    AUTHOR		: Aniruddha Marathe <aniruddha.marathe@wipro.com>
 *
 *    SIGNALS
 * 	Uses SIGUSR1 to pause before test if option set.
 * 	(See the parse_opts(3) man page).
 *
 *    DESCRIPTION
 *     This is a Phase I test for the timer_delete(2) system call.
 *     It is intended to provide a limited exposure of the system call.
 *
 * 	Setup:
 *	  Setup signal handling.
 *	  Pause for SIGUSR1 if option specified.
 *
 * 	Test:
 *	 Loop if the proper options are given.
 *	 Create a POSIX timer
 *	 Execute system call
 *	 Check return code, if system call failed (return=-1)
 *		Log the errno and Issue a FAIL message.
 *	 Otherwise, Issue a PASS message.
 *
 * 	Cleanup:
 * 	  Print errno log and/or timing stats if options given
 *
 * USAGE:  <for command-line>
 * timer_delete02 [-c n] [-e] [-i n] [-I x] [-P x] [-t] [-p]
 * where:
 * 	-c n : Run n copies simultaneously.
 *	-e   : Turn on errno logging.
 *	-i n : Execute test n times.
 *	-I x : Execute test for x seconds.
 *	-p   : Pause for SIGUSR1 before starting
 *	-P x : Pause for x seconds between iterations.
 *	-t   : Turn on syscall timing.
 *
 *RESTRICTIONS:
 * None
