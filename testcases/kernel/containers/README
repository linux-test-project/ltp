CONTAINER TESTS AUTOMATION SUITE
----------------------------
The tests requires the Kernel to  be compiled with the following config's

CONFIG_NAMESPACES=y
CONFIG_UTS_NS=y
CONFIG_IPC_NS=y
CONFIG_USER_NS=y
CONFIG_PID_NS=y
CONFIG_NET_NS=y
CONFIG_VETH=y(or =m)
CONFIG_MACVLAN=y(optional)

The container test automation suite helps run the container functionality
(e.g: utsname etc..) tests and report results. Please refer the following
each functionality README file for detail:

sysvipc/*
	Contains all the testcases related to IPC NS tests.
posixmq/*
	Contains all the testcases related to POSIX MQ NS tests.  These
	are strictly speaking a part of the ipc namespaces, but can be
	enabled in the kernel without SYSV IPC support.
utsname/*
	Contains all the testcases related to utsname tests.
libclone/*
	Contains the library API for clone() .
netns/*
        Contains the testcases related to the network NS tests.
