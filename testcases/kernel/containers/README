CONTAINER TESTS AUTOMATION SUITE
----------------------------
The tests requires the Kernel to  be compiled with the following config's

CONFIG_NAMESPACES=y
CONFIG_UTS_NS=y
CONFIG_IPC_NS=y
CONFIG_USER_NS=y
CONFIG_PID_NS=y
CONFIG_NET_NS=y
CONFIG_VETH=y
CONFIG_MACVLAN=y(optional)

The container test automation suite helps run the container functionality
(e.g: utsname etc..) tests and report results. Please refer the following
each functionality README file for detail:

sysvipc/*
	Contains all the testcases related to IPC NS tests.
posixmq/*
	Contains all the testcases related to POSIX MQ NS tests.  These
	are strictly speaking a part of the ipc namespaces, but can be
	enabled in the kernel without SYSV IPC support.
utsname/*
	Contains all the testcases related to utsname tests.
libclone/*
	Contains the library API for clone() .
netns/*
        Contains the testcases related to the network NS tests. This tests uses
the routes method to define the network namespaces.
	The tests uses the library libclone/libnetns.a, netns/parentns.sh and
netns/childns.sh scripts to define network namespace. 

To run your tests you can execute the runnetnstest.sh .

To run the tests individually :

For Ex: To access a container created

1) You can comment the line in the childns.sh 
  'cleanup $sshpid $vnet1 ' 
2)  run the script to create your first namespace. 
   ./crtchild 
3) Now you can login into the containers using
   ssh -p 7890 root@192.168.0.182

Also the same scripts parentns.sh and childns.sh can be used to 
create a container and write your testcases to test the namespace.

Note:
	This tests would use the following IPaddresses 
running sshd on PORT @ 7890 and @ 9876
	192.168.0.181
	192.168.0.182
	192.168.0.183
	192.168.0.184
