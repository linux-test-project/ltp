 * This file will include functions that will drive the
 * kernel module tusb to test various usb functions
 * and kernel calls. Each function will need to setup the tif
 * structure so that the in parameters and out parameters
 * are correctly initialized
 *
 * use tif structure for passing params between user
 * space and kernel space, in some tests it is really
 * not needed but makes easy to maintain all tests if
 * have the same process to read in params in the
 * kernel module no matter what the test is
