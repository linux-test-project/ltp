# The zram sysfs node 'disksize' value can be either in bytes,
# or you can use mem suffixes. But in some old kernels, mem
# suffixes are not supported, for example, in RHEL6.6GA's kernel
# layer, it uses strict_strtoull() to parse disksize which does
# not support mem suffixes, in some newer kernels, they use
# memparse() which supports mem suffixes. So here we just use
# bytes to make sure everything works correctly.
# Calculate memory to use for zram (200% of ram)
