 * This file will include user space functions that will drive
 * the kernel module to test various functions and kernel
 * calls. Each function will need to setup the tif structure
 * so that the in parameters and out parameters are correctly
 * initialized
 *
 * use bif structure for passing params between user
 * space and kernel space, in some tests it is really not
 * needed, and if nothing is needed to pass in utilize
 * the ki_generic function below. the tif structure makes
 * it easy to maintain all the tests if they have the same
 * process in kernel space to read in params in the kernel
 * module no matter what the test is
