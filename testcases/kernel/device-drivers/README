Device Driver Testcases:

These tests should always be run individually and never concurrently.  Since
these test will manipulate devices and may leave them in an unstable state,
these tests should not be run when other important system tasks are being
performed.  These tests shouldn't be included in any system wide test scripts
as they may corrupt the test data from those tests.

To build and execute these tests:

1) change into each of the directories you want to test and run "make".
2) run the command 'insmod' on the .o file in the kernel space directory.
Note: If the insmod command fails with a QM_MODULE error, the module functions
      are outdated and need to be upgraded.
3) Run "lsmod" to make sure the modules is loaded.
4) Change to the user space program directory and run the *.sh file or the
   program executable.
5) The results should be output to the display.
6) These tests will complete very quickly, usually in a few seconds so if the
   system doesn't return from the test it's probably hung and a re-boot may be
   required.
