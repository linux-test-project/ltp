/* memory between the kernel and user space is
 seperated, so that if a structure is needed
 to be passed between kernel and user space
 a call must be made to copy_to_user or copy
 from user. Use this structure to streamline
 that process. For example: A function that
 writes to a disc takes in a ki_write_t
 pointer from userspace. In the user space
 program specify the length of the pointer as
 in_len, and in_data as the actual structure. */
