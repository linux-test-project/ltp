TEST SUITE:

The directory memcg contains the tests related to memory resource controller.
Those testcases can reproduce bugs we found.

There are total 44 testcases that have been added. These testcases
contain the regression test, basis operation test and stress test of memctl.

NOTE: the test can be run by root only.

TESTS AIM:

The aim of the tests is to track any future regressions, test the functionality
of memctl..
