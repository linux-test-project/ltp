TEST SUITE:

The directory cpuacct contains the tests related to cpu accounting controller.
More testcases are expected to be added in future.

TESTS AIM:

The aim of the tests is to test cpu accounting controller functionality.

FILES DESCRIPTION:

cpuacct_task01.c
---------------
This is the task which is run for eating up the cpu time.


cpuacct_setup.sh
----------
This file contains the functions which are common for all the tests. For ex.
the setup and cleanup functions which do the setup for running the test and do
the cleanup once the test finishes. The setup() function creates /dev/cpuacct
directory and mounts cgroup filesystem on it with accounting  controller. It
then creates a number(n) of groups in /dev/cpuacct. The cleanup function does a
complete cleanup of the system.

Most of the error scenarios have been taken care of for a sane cleanup of the
system. However if cleanup fails in any case, just manually execute the
commands written in cleanup function in setup.sh.
One of the most common causes of failed cleanup is that you have done cd into
any of the groups in controller dir tree.

run_cpuacct_test.sh
------------------
This script creates different scenarios for cpu accounting controller testing and
starting (n) tasks in different groups to do some cpu allocations etc. It
checks for the cpu usage of the groups and reports test pass/fail accordingly.

Makefile

The usual makefile for this directory

PASS/FAIL CRITERION:
==================
The test cases are intelligent enough in deciding the pass or failure of a
test.
