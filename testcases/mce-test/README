MCE test suite
---------------

The MCE test suite is a collection of tools and test scripts for
testing the Linux kernel MCE processing features. The goal is to cover
most Linux kernel MCE processing code paths and features with
automation tests.


In the Package
--------------

Here is a short description of what is included in the package

README
	This document

COPYING
	GNU General Public License

Makefile
	Top level make file for MCE test suite

drivers/*
	Contains test drivers, which drive test procedure and do some
	common works for test drivers. There is one directory for each
	test driver, the user interface of a driver is the driver.sh
	in corresponding directory, such as:
	    drivers/kdump/driver.sh
	is user interface of kdump test driver.

cases/*
	Contains all test cases, which may be organized in
	sub-directories, the interface of a class of test cases is a
	shell script under cases/, such as:
	   -- cases/soft-inj/panic/cases.sh
		is for test cases triggered by soft-inject and may cause system 
		panic during testing.
	   -- cases/apei-inj/ucr/cases.sh  
		is for test cases triggered by apei-inject.

config/*
	Contains test configuration files, which specifies the
	parameters for test driver, which test cases are used in test,
	the parameters for test cases, etc.

tsrc/*
	Some standalone test programs for various parts of the machine
	check code.

lib/*
	Contains some shell scripts, in which some common shell
	functions and variable definitions are defined to be used by
	multiple test drivers or test cases.

tools/*
	Some tools used by MCE test suites.

doc/*
	Documentation for MCE test suites include howto and
	descriptions of every test case.

results/
	When test is done, the test result will be placed in this
	directory, test results for a specific test driver will be
	placed in corresponding directory, such as test results of
	kdump test driver will be placed in "results/kdump". General
	test result is in results/$driver/result; additional results
	of various cases may be in corresponding directory, for
	example, files in
	    results/kdump/soft-inj/panic/fatal/
	is for additional result for test case soft-inj/panic/fatal.

work/
	During test, some temporary file will be put in work
	directory, temporary files for a specific test driver will be
	placed in corresponding directory, such as temporary files of
	kdump test driver will be placed in "work/kdump". Test log is
	in work/$driver/log.

bin/
	Some tools used by test drivers or test cases will be
	installed into this directory.

stress/
	Linux MCE stress test suite.

Test Instruction
----------------

Please refer to corresponding section in doc/howto.txt.

Very quick way to test this:
	be root
	make sure you have a kernel with CONFIG_X86_MCE_INJECT
	and CONFIG_HWPOISON_INJECT and soft-offlining support
	run "make test"
