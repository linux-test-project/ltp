there are 5 sets of datafiles [trigo, power, iperb, exp_log, bessel]

there are 5 testcases [float_trigo, float_power, float_iperb, float_exp_log,
float_bessel]

how to do it
============
1)

first of all you have to generate datafiles, following is the trigo set of
datafiles way of doing:
/* there is a readme file within the directory if necessary */

$ cd trigo

/* compile */
$ make all

/* start the trigo datafiles generator */
$ gentrigo

/* check that make install will install datafiles where they've to be placed */
/* check that repository is existing */
/* see Makefile file */
$ make install

2) do the same with the others (iperb, exp_log, power & bessel)

...........................................................................
3) compiling & installing testcases

$ cd ..
$ make all
$ make install
..........................................................................
/* starting the testcase */
$ cd ../bin
$ float_trigo
$ float_power
$ float_exp_log
$ float_iperb
$ float_bessel
$ echo $?
0
$

Notes:
------
1)
/* datafiles are supposed to be placed to the same directory as executables */
/* this can be changed giving the absolute path of the directory to the
 testcase ex:$ float_trigo -D /home/linux/livr */

2) number of threads is initialized to 20 per function

3) number of loops is initialized to 500 (ability to view cpus loading)

4) these tests have been started on ia64 and ia32 architectures.
