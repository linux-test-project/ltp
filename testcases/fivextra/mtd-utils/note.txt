Lock & unlock cannot work on virtual device
============
The lock and unlock command cannot work yet. Since we used a virtual device
based on system memory for this testcase. Maybe these two commands cannot work
on the virtual device.

I exclude these two testcases.

Nanddump & nandwrite cannot work
============
Both the two utilities complain ``Unknown flash (not normal NAND)''. Maybe
we need another tool nftl_format which did not include in mod-utils package.

I exclude these two testcases.

I found the man page for ftl_format var Internet

NAME
       ftl_format - Flash Translation Layer formatting utility

SYNOPSIS
       ftl_format [-q] [-i] [-s spare] [-r reserve] [-b bootsize] device

DESCRIPTION
       Ftl_format creates a Flash Translation Layer partition on
       a flash memory device. It needs to access the flash
       partition's raw character-mode device (such as /dev/mem0c0c).

       This is actually a low-level format operation, requiredi
       before accessing a memory device via the FTL block device
       driver. Once a partition is prepared with ftl_format, a
       filesystem should be created in a separate step. Filesystem
       commands should access the device via the FTL device file
       (such as /dev/ftl0).

       Optionally, ftl_format can reserve a region at the beginning
       of the flash card address space for a boot image (or any
       other purpose). The boot area is not part of the FTL
       partition, and can only be accessed via the raw memory device.

       On Intel Series 100 flash cards, the first flash block is
       used to store the card's configuration information structures.
       If no boot area is specified on the command line, ftl_format
       will automatically create one to span the first block.

OPTIONS
       -q
              Quiet mode: don't print formatting statistics.

       -i
              Interactive: confirm before beginning the format.

       -s spare
              Reserve the specified number of erase blocks as spares.
              The default is 1. A read-write partition requires at
              least one spare block.

       -r reserve
              Reserve the specified percentage of the total space on
              the device to improve write efficiency. The default is
              5%. Reserving less space increases the frequency of
              flash erase operations to reclaim free blocks.

       -b bootsize
              Requests that a portion of the flash card be reserved
              for a boot image. The size will be rounded up to an
              integral number of erase blocks.
