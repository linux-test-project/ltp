This sub-directory contains test cases testing functional
area defined by POSIX.
It is still open WRT how to organize the test cases clearly.
For the first steps, we will organize the test cases by
funtional area (somewhat like POSIX options), or by APIs.

Currently it contains:

condvar - Test cases by Abhijeet Bisain. Testing pthread_cond_wait()
scheduling behavior when threads has realtime priority.

pi_test - Test Priority Inheritence.

robust_test - This suite is not proper to exist in PTS, since
the work of adding Robust Mutex to POSIX is still on going.
