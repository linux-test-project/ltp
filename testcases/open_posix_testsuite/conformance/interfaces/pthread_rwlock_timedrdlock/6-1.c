 * Test pthread_rwlock_timedrdlock(pthread_rwlock_t * rwlock)
 *
 * If a signal that causes a signal handler to be executed is delivered to
 * a thread blocked on a read-write lock via a call to pthread_rwlock_timedrdlock(),
 * upon return from the signal handler the thread shall resume waiting for the lock
 * as if it was not interrupted.
 *
 * Test that after returning from a signal handler, the reader will continue
 * to wait with timedrdlock as long as the specified 'timeout' does not expire (the
 * time spent in signal handler is longer than the specified 'timeout').
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1. main thread  create and write lock 'rwlock'
 * 2. main thread create a thread sig_thread, the thread is set to handle SIGUSR1
 * 3. sig_thread timed read-lock 'rwlock' for reading, it should block
 * 4. While the sig_thread is waiting (not expired yet), main thread sends SIGUSR1
 *    to sig_thread via pthread_kill
 * 5. Check that when thread handler returns, sig_thread resume block
 * 7. When the wait is terminated, check that the thread wait for a proper period before
 *    expiring.
