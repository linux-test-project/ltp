 * Test that when  pthread_cond_destroy()
 *   is called on a cond that some thread is waiting, then it returns
 *   EBUSY

 * Steps:
 * 1. Create a condvar
 * 2. Create a thread and make it wait on the condvar
 * 3. Try to destroy the cond var in main
 * 4. Check that pthread_cond_destroy returns EBUSY
