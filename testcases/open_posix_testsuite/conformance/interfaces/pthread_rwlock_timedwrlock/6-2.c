 * Test pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock(pthread_rwlock_t * rwlock)
 *
 * If a signal that causes a signal handler to be executed is delivered to
 * a thread blocked on a read-write lock via a call to pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock(),
 * upon return from the signal handler the thread shall resume waiting for the lock
 * as if it was not interrupted.
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1. main thread  create read-write lock 'rwlock', and lock it for writing
 * 2. main thread create a thread sig_thread, the thread is set to handle SIGUSR1
 * 3. sig_thread timed lock 'rwlock' for writing, but blocked
 * 4. While the sig_thread is waiting(not expried yet), main thread send SIGUSR1
 *    to sig_thread via pthread_kill
 * 5. test that thread handler is called, inside the handler, make the thread sleep
 *    for a period that the specified 'timeout' for pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock()
 *    should have expired (timeout * 2)
 * 6. While sig_thread sleeping in signal handler, main thread unlock 'rwlock'
 * 7. check that when thread handler returns, sig_thread get the read lock without
 *    getting ETIMEDOUT.
