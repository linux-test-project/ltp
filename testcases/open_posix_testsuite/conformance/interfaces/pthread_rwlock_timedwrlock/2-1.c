 * Test that pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock(pthread_rwlock_t *rwlock)
 *
 *	The timeout shall expire when the absolute time specified by abs_timeout passes,
 *	as measured by the clock on which timeouts are based (that is, when the
 *	value of that clock equals or exceeds abs_timeout), or if the absolute time
 *	specified by abs_timeout has already been passed at the time of the call.
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1.  Initialize 'rwlock'
 * 2.  Main thread locks 'rwlock' for writing with pthread_rwlock_wrlock()
 * 3.  Create a child thread, specify a 'abs_timeout' as being the current time _minus_ a
 *     timeout period, meaning this will ensure that the abs_timeout would have already
 *     passed.
 * 4.  The thread locks 'rwlock' for writing, using pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock(). Should
 *	get an ETIMEOUT error.
