 * Test that pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock(pthread_rwlock_t *rwlock)
 *
 *	pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock() function shall apply a write lock to the
 *	read-write lock referenced by rwlock as in the pthread_rwlock_wrlock() function.
 *	However, if the lock cannot be acquired without waiting for other threads to
 *	unlock the lock, this wait shall be terminate when the specified timeout expires.
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1.  Initialize rwlock
 * 2.  Main creats thread0.
 * 3.  Thread0 does pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock(), should get the lock successfully then unlock.
 * 4.  Main thread locks 'rwlock' for reading with pthread_rwlock_rdlock()
 * 5.  Create a child thread, the thread time-locks 'rwlock' for writing,
 *	using pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock(), should block, but when the timer expires,
 *	that wait will be terminated.
 * 6.  Main thread unlocks 'rwlock'
 * 7.  Main thread locks 'rwlock' for writing.
 * 8.  Create child thread to lock 'rwlock' for writing, using pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock,
 *	 it should block but when the timer expires, the wait will be terminated
 * 8.  Main thread unlocks 'rwlock'
