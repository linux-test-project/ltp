 * object exists and it is successfully opened O_RDWR.
 *
 * In most case this test will be unresolved if not run by root.
 * Steps:
 *  1. Create a shared memory object.
 *  2. Set a non zero size for this object (to force the modification of the
 *     object when it will be reopen with O_TRUNC set).
 *  3. Set his effective user id to an other user id which is not root.
 *  4. Call shm_open with O_TRUNC set.
 *  5. Check that the owner is unchanged.
