 * Test that the state of the shared memory object, including all data
 * associated with the shared memory object, persists until the shared memory
 * object is unlinked even if all other references are gone.
 *
 * Steps:
 *  1. Create a shared memory object, map it and write a string in it.
 *  2. Unmap the memory and close the file descriptor.
 *  3. Reopen the shared memory object and remap it.
 *  4. Check that the previously written string is always in the memory.
