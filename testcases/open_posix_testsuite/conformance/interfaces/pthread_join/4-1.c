* This sample test aims to check the following assertion:
*
* If the thread calling pthread_join is canceled, the joined thread
* remains joinable.
*
* The steps are:
* -> create a thread blocked on a mutex.
* -> create another thread which tries and join the first thread.
* -> cancel the 2nd thread.
* -> unblock the semaphore then join the 1st thread
* The test fails if the main thread is unable to join the 1st thread.
