 * Test pthread_setcanceltype
 * Atomically sets the cancelability type to 'type' and returns the old
 * cancelability type in the location referenced by 'oldtype'.
 * 'state' can either be PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED, or PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS.
 *
 * Test when a thread is PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS
 *
 * STEPS:
 * 1. Setup a mutex and lock it in main()
 * 2. Create a thread.
 * 3. In the thread function, set the type to PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS
 * 4. Setup a cleanup handler for the thread.
 * 5. Make the thread block on the locked mutex
 * 6. Send out a thread cancel request to the new thread
 * 7. If the cancel request was honored immediately and correctly, the
 *    cleanup handler would have been executed, and the test will pass.
 * 8. If not, main will wait for 10 seconds before it  unlocks the mutex, and the thread
 *    will exit, failing the test.
