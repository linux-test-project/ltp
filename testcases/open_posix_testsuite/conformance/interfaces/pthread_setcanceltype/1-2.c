 * Test pthread_setcanceltype
 * Atomically sets the cancelability type to 'type' and returns the old
 * cancelability type in the location referenced by 'oldtype'.
 * 'state' can either be PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED, or PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS.
 *
 * Test when a thread is PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED
 *
 * STEPS:
 * 1. Setup a mutex and lock it in main()
 * 2. Create a thread.
 * 3. In the thread function, set the type to PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED
 * 4. Setup a cleanup handler for the thread.
 * 5. Make the thread block on the locked mutex
 * 6. Send out a thread cancel request to the new thread, and unlock the mutex allowing the
 *    thread to continue execution.
 * 7. If the cancel request was honored immediately, the
 *    cleanup handler would have been executed, setting the cleanup_flag to -1, making the
 *    test fail.
 * 8. If not, the thread will continue execution, pop the cleanup handler, set the cleanup
 *    flag to 1, and call the cancelation point pthread_testcancel(). The test will pass.
 * 9. If the thread did not cancel at the cancelation point like it was supposed to, the thread
 *    will continue execution and set the cleanup_flag to -2, failing the test.
