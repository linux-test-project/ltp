 Assumption: The test assumes that this program is run under normal conditions,
 and not when the processor and other resources are too stressed.

 This program checks to see that sigsuspend does not return when sent a signal
 whose action is to terminate the process.

 Steps:
 1. Fork() a child.
 2. Have the parent give the child a 1 second headstart. Have the child suspend itself.
 3. Have the parent send the child a SIGABRT signal. The default action associated with SIGABRT
    is to terminate the program. sigsuspend() should not return, and if it does, then have the
    child return a to the parent with 1 or 2.
 4. From the parent, verify that the child neither returns 1 or 2.
