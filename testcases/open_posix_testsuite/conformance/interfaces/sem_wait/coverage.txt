Will not test the following error values of the semaphores because it is
unknown to me of how to return these values.

-- EDEADLK:  A deadlock condition was detected.

-- assertion 6: not tested.

-- assertion 9: is being covered in the other sem_wait cases.

TODO: Help create a test case for the EDEADLK ERROR code.
