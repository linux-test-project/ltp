 * pthread_barrier_wait()
 *
 * If a signal is delivered to a thread blocked on a barrier, upon return
 * from the signal handler the thread shall resume waiting at the barrier
 * if the barrier wait has not completed (that is, if the
 * required number of threads have not arrived at the barrier
 * during the execution of the signal handler);
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1. Main initialize barrier with count 2
 * 2. Main create a child thread
 * 3. Child thread call pthread_barrier_wait(), should block
 * 4. While child thread is blocking, send SIGUSR1 to child
 * 5. The signal handler did nothing just print a message
 * 6. After return from the signal handler, child should resume blocking
 * 7. Main call pthread_barrier_wait(), child and main should all return
 *    from pthread_barrier_wait()
