 * Test that the named shared memory object is not changed by this function
 * call when the process does not have permission to unlink the name.
 *
 * Steps:
 *  1. Create a shared memory object.
 *  2. Set his effective user id to an other user id which is not root.
 *  3. Try to unlink the name.
 *     If it fail: set the effective user id to real user id and unlink.
 * In most case this test will be unresolved if not run by root.
