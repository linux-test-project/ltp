 * Test that after a timer is deleted by calling timer_delete(), it
 * cannot be armed by calling timer_settime().
 * Steps:
 * - Create a timer
 * - Delete that timer
 * - Try to call timer_settime() on that timer and ensure it fails
 *   with errno==EINVAL.
 *
 * For this test, signal SIGTOTEST will be used, clock CLOCK_REALTIME
 * will be used.
