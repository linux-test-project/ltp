    The function will map the error number accessed through the symbol errno to
    a language-dependent error message, which will be written to the standard
    error stream as follows:
        • First (if s is not a null pointer and the character pointed to by s
          is not the null byte), the string pointed to by s followed by a
          'colon' and a 'space'.
        • Then an error message string followed by a 'newline'.
  <assertion>
  <assertion id="2" tag="ref:XBD7:47410:47411">
    The contents of the error message strings will be the same as those returned
    by strerror( ) with argument errno.
  <assertion>
  <assertion id="3" tag="ref:XBD7:47412:47414">
    The function will mark for update the last data modification and last file
    status change timestamps of the file associated with the standard error
    stream at some time between its successful completion and exit( ),
    abort( ), or the completion of fflush( ) or fclose( ) on stderr.

  <assertion id="4" tag="ref:XBD7:47415:47415">
    The function will not change the orientation of the standard error stream.

  <assertion id="5" tag="ref:XBD7:47416:47417">
    On error, perror( ) will set the error indicator for the stream to which
    stderr points, and shall set errno to indicate the error.

  <assertion id="6" tag="ref:XBD7:47422:47422">
    The function will not return a value.
