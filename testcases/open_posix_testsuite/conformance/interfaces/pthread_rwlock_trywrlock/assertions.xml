	pthread_rwlock_trywrlock( ) function shall apply a write lock like the
	pthread_rwlock_wrlock( ) function, with the exception that the function
	shall fail if any thread currently holds rwlock (for reading or writing)
  </assertion>

  <assertion id="2" tag="ref:XSH6:34798:34800">
	The pthread_rwlock_trywrlock( ) function shall return zero if the lock for writing on
	the read-write lock object referenced by rwlock is acquired. Otherwise, an error number
	shall be returned to indicate the error.

  <assertion id="3" tag="ref:XSH6:34802:34804">
	The pthread_rwlock_trywrlock( ) function shall fail if:

	[EBUSY] The read-write lock could not be acquired for writing because a writer holds
	the lock or a writer with the appropriate priority was blocked on it.

	It may fail if:
	[EINVAL] rwlock does not refer to an initialized read-write lock object

	It shall not return EINTR.
