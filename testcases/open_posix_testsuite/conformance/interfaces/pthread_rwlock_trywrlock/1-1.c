 * Test pthread_rwlock_trywrlock(pthread_rwlock_t *rwlock)
 *
 * The function shall apply a write lock like the pthread_rwlock_wrlock(), with the exception
 * that the function shall fail if any thread currently holds rwlock(for reading and writing).
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1.  Initialize a pthread_rwlock_t object 'rwlock' with pthread_rwlock_init()
 * 2.  Main thread lock 'rwlock' for reading with pthread_rwlock_rdlock()
 * 3.  Create a child thread, the thread locks 'rwlock' for writing, using
 *     pthread_rwlock_trywrlock(), should get EBUSY
 * 4.  Main thread unlocks 'rwlock'
 * 5.  Main thread locks 'rwlock' for writing, using pthread_rwlock_trywrlock(),
 *     should get the lock successfully
 * 6.  Create child thread to lock 'rwlock' for writing, with pthread_rwlock_trywrlock(),
 *     should get EBUSY
 * 7.  Main thread unlock 'rwlock'
