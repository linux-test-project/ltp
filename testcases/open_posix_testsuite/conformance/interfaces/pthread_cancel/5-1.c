 * Test pthread_cancel
 * It may return an error number of:
 * -[ESRCH] No thread could be found corresponding to that thread ID

 * It shall not return an error code of [EINTR]
*
 * STEPS:
 * 1. Create a thread
 * 2. Wait 'till the thread has ended execution
 * 3. Send a cancel request to the thread (which isn't existing anymore)
 * 3. It should return an error code of [ESRCH], else test fails.
