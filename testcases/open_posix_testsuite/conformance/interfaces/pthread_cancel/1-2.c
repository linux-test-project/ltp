 * Test pthread_cancel
 * Shall request that 'thread' shall be canceled.  The target thread's
 * cancelability state and type determines when the cancelation takes
 * effect.
 *
 * Test when a thread is PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE
 *
 * STEPS:
 * 1. Create a thread.
 * 2. In the thread function, set the state to
 *    PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE
 * 3. Setup a cleanup handler for the thread.
 * 4. Send out a thread cancel request to the new thread
 * 5. If the cancel request was honored, the cleanup handler would have
 *    been executed and the test will fail.
 * 6. If not, the thread will continue until the end of execution and exit
 *    correctly, therefore passing the test.
