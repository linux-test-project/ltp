 * Test pthread_cancel
 * Shall request that 'thread' shall be canceled.  The target thread's
 * cancelability state and type determines when the cancelation takes
 * effect.
 *
 * Test when a thread is PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE and PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS
 *
 * STEPS:
 * 1. Create a thread.
 * 2. In the thread function, set the set and type to
 *    PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE and PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS
 * 3. Setup a cleanup handler for the thread.
 * 4. Send out a thread cancel request to the new thread
 * 5. If the cancel request was honored immediately and correctly, the
 *    cleanup handler would have been executed, and the test will pass.
 * 6. If not, the thread will wait for 10 seconds before it exits itself,
 *    and the test will fail.
