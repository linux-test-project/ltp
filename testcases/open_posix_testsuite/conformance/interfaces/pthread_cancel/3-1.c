 * Test pthread_cancel
 * When the cancelation is acted on, the cancelation cleanup handlers for
 * 'thread' shall be called "asynchronously"
 *
 * STEPS:
 * 1. Change main thread to a real-time thread with a high priority
 * 1. Create a lower priority thread
 * 2. In the thread function, push a cleanup function onto the stack
 * 3. Cancel the thread from main and get timestamp, then block.
 * 4. The cleanup function should be automatically
 *    executed, else the test will fail.
