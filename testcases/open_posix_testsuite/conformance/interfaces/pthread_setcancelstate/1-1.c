 * Test pthread_cancelstate
 * Atomically sets the cancelability state to 'state' and returns the old
 * cancelability state in the location referenced by 'oldstate'.
 * 'state' can either be PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE, or PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE.
 *
 * Test when a thread is PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE
 *
 * STEPS:
 * 1. Create a thread.
 * 2. In the thread function, set the state to
 *    PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE and the cancel_flag to 1.
 * 3. Send out a thread cancel request to the new thread
 * 4. If the cancel request was honored, the cancel_flag will remain 1.
 * 5. If not, the thread will continue until the end of execution, cancel_flag will be set to -1
 *    and,therefore failing the test.
