*Decided against testing this assertion as it would be quite difficult
to get an accurate test.

Possible other items to test:
assertion 6 - What happens if it_interval < it_value? - Would be easy to
use code from 6-1 and replace numbers to test this.

May also want to run canned boundary tests on tid values.
