 This program tests the assertion that if the ss_flags member is not set to SS_DISABLE,
 the stack shall be enabled, and the ss_sp and ss_size members specify the new address
 and size of the stack.

 Steps:
 - Set up a handler for signal SIGTOTEST and set the sa_flags member to SA_ONSTACK.
 - Allocate memory for the alternate signal stack
 - call sigaltstack() to define the alternate signal stack
 - raise SIGTOTEST
 - Inside the handler, use sigaltstack to examine/obtain the current alternate signal
   stack and verify that the ss_flags member of the obtained alternate signal stack is SS_ONSTACK.
