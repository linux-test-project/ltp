// Applied patch from Craig Rodrigues; no longer assumes CLOCKS_PER_SEC is long
// 12-18-02 Per suggestion by neal REMOVE-THIS AT cs DOT uml DOT edu started
// using intmax_h and INTMAX_C.  Also added use of PRIdMAX per his suggestion.

#include <time.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <inttypes.h>
#include "posixtest.h"

#define EXPECTEDVALUE INTMAX_C(1000000)

int main(int argc, char *argv[])

	intmax_t clocks_per_sec = (intmax_t)CLOCKS_PER_SEC;

	if (EXPECTEDVALUE == CLOCKS_PER_SEC) {
