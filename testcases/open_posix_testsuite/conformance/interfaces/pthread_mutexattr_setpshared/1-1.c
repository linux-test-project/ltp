 * Test that pthread_mutexattr_setpshared()
 *
 *  It shall set the process-shared attribute in an initialized attributes object 'attr'.

 * The process-shared attribute is set to PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED to permit a mutex to be
 * operated upon by any thread that has access to the memory where the mutex is allocated,
 * even if the mutex is allocated in memory that is shared by multiple processes.
 *
 * If the process-shared attribute is PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE, the mutex shall only be
 * operated upon by threads created within the same process as the thread that initialized
 * the mutex; if threads of differing processes attempt to operate on such a mutex,
 * the behavior is undefined.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * Explanation:  To share a mutex between 2 processes, you need to map shared memory for
 * the mutex.  So whether the 'type' of the mutexattr is shared or private, it really will
 * not make a difference since both processes will always have access to the shared memory
 * as long as they the pointer to it.  So all we check here is that you can actually call
 * the pthread_mutexattr_setpshared() function, passing to it PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED and
 * PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE.
 *
 * 1. Initialize a pthread_mutexattr_t object.
 * 2. Call pthread_mutexattr_getpshared(), passing to it both PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARE and
 *    PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE.
