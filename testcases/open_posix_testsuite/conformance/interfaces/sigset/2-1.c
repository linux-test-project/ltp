 This program tests the assertion that the signal shall be ignored
 if the value of the dist parameter is SIG_IGN.

 How this program tests this assertion is by setting up a handler
 "myhandler" for SIGUSR1. Then another call to signal() is made about
 SIGUSR1, this time with SIG_IGN as the value of the func parameter.
 SIGUSR1 should be ignored now, so unless myhandler gets called when
 SIGUSR1 is raised, the test passes, otherwise returns failure.
