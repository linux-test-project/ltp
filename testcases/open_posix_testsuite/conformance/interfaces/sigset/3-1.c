 This program tests the assertion that the function shall be executed
 when the signal occurs if the disp parameter is the address of a function.

 How this program tests this assertion is by setting up a handler
 "myhandler" for SIGCHLD, and then raising that signal. If the
 handler_called variable is anything but 1, then fail, otherwise pass.
