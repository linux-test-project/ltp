 * Test that pthread_key_create()
 *
 * If successful, the pthread_key_create() function shall store the newly created key value
 * at *key and shall return zero.  Otherwise, an error number shall be returned to indicate
 * an error:
 *
 * [EAGAIN] - the system lacked the necessary resources to create another thread_specific
 *            data key, or the system imposed limit on the total number of keys per process
 *            [PTHREAD_KEYS_MAX] has been exceeded.
 *
 * [ENOMEM] - insufficient memory exists to create the key.
 *
 * TESTING [EAGAIN]
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1. Define an array of keys
 * 2. Use pthread_key_create() and create those keys
 * 3. Verify that you can set and get specific values for those keys without errors.
