-- assertion 4: Not tested.  Help needed!

-- assertion 7: Not tested.  I couldn't find a way to exhaust
the system in order to satisfy this test case.

-- assertion 8: Not tested.  I couldn't figure out how to make
this test case to happen.  In NPTL, the semaphore creator has to
be root, and the semaphore is  created in /dev/shm file system.
Any other user can't create under that file system.
