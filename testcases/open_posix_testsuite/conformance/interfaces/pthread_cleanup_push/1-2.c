 * void pthread_cleanup_push(void (*routine) (void*), void *arg);
 *
 * Shall push the specified cancelation cleanup handler routine onto the calling thread's
 * cancelation cleanup stack. The cancelation cleanup handler shall be popped from the
 * cancelation cleanup stack and invoked with the argument arg when:
 *
 * (a)- The thread exits (calls pthread_exit())
 * (b)- The thread acts upon a cancelation request
 * (c)- the thread calls pthread_cleanup_pop() with a non-zero execution argument
 *
 *  Testing (b)
 *
 * STEPS:
 * 1. Create a thread
 * 2. In the thread, push a cancelation handler
 * 3. Main will cancel the thread before the thread exits
 * 4. Verify that the cleanup handler was called
