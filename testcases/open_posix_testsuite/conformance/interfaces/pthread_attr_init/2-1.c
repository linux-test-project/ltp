 * Test the resulting attributes object (possibly modified by setting individual
 * attribute values) when used by pthread_create() defines the attributes of
 * the thread created.
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1.  Initialize a pthread_attr_t object using pthread_attr_init()
 * 2.  Pass the newly created attribute object to pthread_create()
 * 3.  Test that thread is joinable, since using pthread_attr_init() will
 *     set the default detachstate to PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE.
 * 4.  Pthread_detach() to test this.  It should
 *     not return errors since the thread should be joinable (non-detached).  If it
 *     returns an error, that means that the thread is not joinable, but rather
 *     in a detached state, and the test fails.
