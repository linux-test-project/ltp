  Test assertion #11 by verifying that SIGCHLD signals are sent to a parent
  when their children are continued after being stopped.

  NOTE: This is only required to work if the XSI options are implemented.
 * 12/18/02 - Adding in include of sys/time.h per
 *            rodrigc REMOVE-THIS AT attbi DOT com input that it needs
 *            to be included whenever the timeval struct is used.
