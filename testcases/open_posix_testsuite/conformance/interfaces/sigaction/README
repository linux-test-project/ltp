I have added a cheezy perl script for generating a bunch of test cases
where I want to do the same simple operation on each signal.

Templates are in the templates directory, and are of the form
template_ASSERTIONID-count.in

gentest.pl will generate a ASSERTIONID-COUNT.c for each signal specified
in the POSIX definition of required signals where %%MYSIG%% is replaced
with the signal name.

* Assertion #5: Since almost all of the test cases in this directory assume
                that this assertion is true, I haven't bothered adding
                a test case that just test assertion #5.
