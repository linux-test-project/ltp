  Test case for assertion #3 of the sigaction system call that shows
  calling sigaction with a null act argument does not change the
  signal handler.

  Steps:
  1. Initialize global variable to indicate handler has not been called
  2. Set the signal handler for %%MYSIG%% to handler
  3. Call sigaction with a null act
  4. raise %%MYSIG%%
  5. Verify handler was called.
