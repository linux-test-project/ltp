   The function

   int pthread_mutexattr_setprioceiling(pthread_mutexattr_t *attr,

  sets the priority ceiling attribute of a mutexattr object (which was prev. created
  by the function pthread_mutexattr_init()).

  'Prioceiling' contains the priority ceiling of initialized mutexes.  The values of
  'prioceiling' are within the maximum range of priorites defined by SCHED_FIFO.
