  The fsync( ) function shall request that all data for the open file descriptor named by
  fildes is to be transferred to the storage device associated with the file described by
  fildes in an implementation-defined manner.

   <assertion id="2" tag="ref:XSH6:14786:14787">
  The fsync( ) function shall not return until the system has
  completed that action or until an error is detected.

   SIO If _POSIX_SYNCHRONIZED_IO is defined, the fsync( ) function shall force all currently
   queuee I/O operations associated with the file indicated by file descriptor fildes to the
   synchronized I/O completion state. All I/O operations shall be completed as defined for
   synchronized I/O file integrity completion.

   Upon successful completion, fsync( ) shall return 0. Otherwise, .1 shall be returned and
