  <assertion id="1" tag="ref:XSH6:31769:31772">
  The pthread_barrier_init( ) function shall allocate any resources required to use the barrier
  referenced by barrier and shall initialize the barrier with attributes referenced by attr. If
  attr is NULL, the default barrier attributes shall be used; the effect is the same as passing
  the address of a default barrier attributes object.
  </assertion>

  <assertion id="2" tag="ref:XSH6:31786:31787">
  Upon successful completion, these functions shall return zero; otherwise, an error number shall
  be returned to indicate the error.
  </assertion>

  <assertion id="3" tag="ref:XSH6:31794:31797">
   The pthread_barrier_init( ) function shall fail if:
   [EAGAIN] The system lacks the necessary resources to initialize another barrier.
   [EINVAL] The value specified by count is equal to zero.
   [ENOMEM] Insufficient memory exists to initialize the barrier.
  </assertion>

  <assertion id="4" tag="ref:XSH6:31803:31803">
    The pthread_barrier_init( ) function may fail if:
    [EBUSY] The implementation has detected an attempt to reinitialize a barrier while it is
    in use (for example, while being used in a pthread_barrier_wait( ) call) by
    another thread.
   [EINVAL] The value specified by attr is invalid.

   These functions shall not return an error code of [EINTR].
