 * Test that pthread_mutexattr_getprioceiling()
 *
 * Gets the priority ceiling attribute of a mutexattr object (which was prev. created
 * by the function pthread_mutexattr_init()).
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1.  Initialize a pthread_mutexattr_t object with pthread_mutexattr_init()
 * 2.  Get the min and max boundries for SCHED_FIFO of what prioceiling can be.
 * 3.  In a for loop, go through each valid SCHED_FIFO value, set the prioceiling, then
 *     get the prio ceiling.  These should always be the same.  If not, fail the test.
