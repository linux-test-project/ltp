 *  Test that the kill() function shall send signal sig to the process
 *  specified by pid.
 *  1) Set up a signal handler for the signal that says we have caught the
 *     signal.
 *  2) Call kill on the current process with the signal.
 *  3) If signal handler was called, test passed.
 *  This test is only performed on one signal.  All other signals are
 *  considered to be in the same equivalence class.
