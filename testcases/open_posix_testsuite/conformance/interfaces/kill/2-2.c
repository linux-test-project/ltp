 *  Test that when the null signal is sent to kill(), error checking is
 *  still performed.
 *  1) Send a signal to generate an ESRCH error.
 *     ==> Send a signal to PID 999999
 *  2) Verify ESRCH error received and kill() returned -1.
 *  3) Send a signal to generate an EPERM error.
 *     ==> Set UID to 1 and send a signal to init (pid = 1)
 *  4) Verify EPERM error received and kill() returned -1.
 *
 *  Note:  These tests make the assumptions that:
 *         - They will be running as root.
 *         - The PID 999999 can never exist.
 *         - The UID 1 is available for assignment and cannot sent
 *           signals to root.
 *         *** I need to check to see if these assumptions are always valid.
