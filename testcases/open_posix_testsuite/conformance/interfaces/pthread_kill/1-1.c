 This program verifies that the pthread_kill() function requests from the
 kernel to deliver a specified signal to a specified thread.

 Using two global values of sem1 (INTHREAD and INMAIN), we are going to
 control  when we want execution to be in main() and when we want
 execution to be a_thread_func(). When the main() function sets sem1 to
 INTHREAD and keeps looping until sem1 gets changed back to INMAIN, the
 a_thread_func() will be exclusively running. Similarly, when the
 a_thread_func() sets sem1 to INMAIN and keeps looping until sem1 gets
 changed back to INTHREAD, the main() function will be exclusively
 running.

 Steps:
 1. From the main() function, create a new thread. Using the above
    methodology, let the new thread run "exclusively."
 2. Inside the new thread, prepare for catching the signal indicated by
    SIGTOTEST, and calling a handler that sets handler_called to 1. Now
    let the main() thread run "exclusively".
 3. Have main() send the signal indicated by SIGTOTEST to the new thread,
    using pthread_kill(). Let the new thread continue running,
    and from the main function, wait until handler_called is set to
    something other than 0.
 4. In the new thread, if the handler wasn't called for more than 5
    seconds, then set handler_called to -1, otherwise set it to 1.
 5. In either case, the main() function will continue execution and return
    a PTS_PASS if handler_called was 1, and a PTS_FAIL if handler_called
    was -1.
