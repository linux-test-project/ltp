 *  Test that when signo in sigqueue() is 0, error checking is
 *  still performed.

 *  Steps:

 *  Call sigqueue() with signo equal to zero but pid is 999999
 *  and verify that ESRCH error received and sigqueue() returned -1.

 *  Call sigqueue() with signo equal to zero but pid is 1 (init)
 *  and verify EPERM error received and kill() returned -1.
