 This program verifies that if the value of pid causes signo to be
 generated for the sending process, and if signo is not blocked for
 the calling thread and if no other thread has signo unblocked or is
 waiting in a sigwait() function for signo, then signal SIGTOTEST
 is delivered to the calling thread before the sigqueue() function returns.

 Steps:
 - Register for myhandler to be called when SIGTOTEST is called, and make
   sure SA_SIGINFO is set.
 - Using sigqueue(), send SIGTOTEST to the current process.
 - Inside handler, verify that the global return_val variable has not been
   set yet to the return value of sigqueue. If it has, then that means that
   sigqueu has returned before the handler finished executing, and thus is
   a FAILED test.
 - Also before the program ends, verify that the handler
   has been called.
