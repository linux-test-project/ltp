 This program tests the assertion that the lowest pending signal will be
 selected for delivery if there are any multiple pending signals in the
 range SIGRTMIN to SIGRTMAX.

 Steps:
 - Register for myhandler to be called when any signal between SIGRTMIN
   and SIGRTMAX is generated, and make
   sure SA_SIGINFO is set.
 - Also, make sure that all of these signals are added to the handler's
   signal mask.
 - Initially block all of these signals from the process.
 - Raise all of these signals using sigqueue.
 - Unblock all of these queued signals simultaneously using sigprocmask.
 - Verify that the signals are delivered in order from smallest to
   biggest.
