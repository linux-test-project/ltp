 *  Test that the sigwait() function.
 *  If prior to the call to sigwait() there are multiple pending instances of
 *  a single signal number (and it is implementation-defined that the signal
 *  number supports queued signals), then there should be remaining
 *  pending signals for that signal number.
 *  Steps are:
 *  1)  Block a signal that supports queueing (the realtime signal SIGRTMIN).
 *  2)  Raise that signal 2 times.
 *  3)  Call sigwait()
 *  4)  Verify that is cleared only one instance of the signal in the pending
 *      set.
 *  5) Call sigwait() again to clear the second instance of the signal in the
 *     pending list.
 *  6) Verify that there are no more instances for SIGRTMIN in the pending list. *
