 * Test that pthread_rwlock_unlock(pthread_rwlock_t *rwlock)
 *
 * pthread_rwlock_unlock() function shall release a lock held on the
 * read-write lock object referenced by rwlock
 * If this function is called to release a write lock for this read-write
 * lock object, the read-write lock object shall be put in the unlocked state.
 *
 * In the case: if a lock in an unlocked state, it can be acquired by a thread for write lock
 * successfully
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1.  Initialize a pthread_rwlock_t object 'rwlock' with pthread_rwlock_init()
 * 2.  Main thread write lock 'rwlock'
 * 3.  Create a child thread, the thread write lock 'rwlock', should block
 * 4.  Main thread unlock the write lock, the 'rwlock' is in unlocked state
 * 5.  Child thread should get the lock for writing.
