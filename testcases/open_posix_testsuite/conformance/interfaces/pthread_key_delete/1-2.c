 * Test that pthread_key_delete()
 *
 * Shall delete a thread-specific data key previously returned by pthread_key_create.  The
 * thread-specific data values specified data values associated with 'key' need not be NULL at
 * the time pthread_key_delete is called.  It is the responsibility of the application to free
 * any application storage or perform any cleanup actions for data structures related to the
 * deleted key or associated thread-specific data in any threads; this cleanup can be done
 * either before or after pthread_key_delete is called.  Any attempt to use 'key' following
 * the call to pthread_key_delete results in undefined behavior.
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1. Create many keys, and specify and value to them
 * 2. Delete the keys with pthread_key_delete
 * 3. Verify that this will not result in an error
