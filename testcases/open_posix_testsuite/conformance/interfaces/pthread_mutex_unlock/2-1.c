 * Test that pthread_mutex_unlock()
 *   If there are threads blocked on the mutex object referenced by 'mutex' when
 *   pthread_mutex_unlock() is called, resulting in the mutex becoming available,
 *   the scheduling policy shall determine which thread shall acquire the mutex.

 * NOTES:
 *   The default scheduling policy is implementation dependent, thus this case
 *   will only demo the scheduling sequence instead of testing it.

 * Steps:
 *   -- Initialize a mutex to protect a global variable 'value'
 *   -- Create N threads. Each is looped M times to acquire the mutex,
        increase the value, and then release the mutex.
 *   -- Check if the value has increased properly (M*N); a broken mutex
        implementation may cause lost augments.
