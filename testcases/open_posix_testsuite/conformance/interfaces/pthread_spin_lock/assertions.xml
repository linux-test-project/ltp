 The function shall lock the spin lock referenced by lock. The calling thread
 shall acquire the lock if it is not held by another thread. Otherwise, the
 thread shall spin (that is, shall not return from the pthread_spin_lock())
 until the lock becomes available.

   Upon successful completion, these functions shall return zero; otherwise, an error number
   shall be returned to indicate the error.

  <assertion id="3" tag="ref:XSH6:35545:35549">
  The pthread_spin_lock( ) function may fail if:

  [EDEADLK] The calling thread already holds the lock.
  [EINVAL] The value specified by lock does not refer to an initialized spin lock object.

  These functions shall not return an error code of EINTR.
