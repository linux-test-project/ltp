 * Test pthread_spin_lock(pthread_spinlock_t *lock)
 *
 * The function shall lock the spin lock referenced by lock. The calling thread
 * shall acquire the lock if it is not held by another thread. Otherwise, the
 * thread shall spin (that is, shall not return from the pthread_spin_lock())
 * until the lock becomes available.
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1.  Initialize a pthread_spinlock_t object 'spinlock' with
 *     pthread_spin_init()
 * 2.  Main thread lock 'spinlock', should get the lock
 * 3.  Create a child thread. The thread lock 'spinlock', should spin.
 * 4.  Main thread unlock 'spinlock'
 * 5.  Child thread should get 'spinlock'
