   Test the error condition of calling sigdelset() to delete a signal not
   there.
   Test steps:
   1)  Initialize an empty signal set.
   2)  Verify the SIGCHLD signal is not in the empty signal set.
   3)  Attempt to remove the SIGCHLD signal from the signal set.
   4)  Verify the SIGCHLD signal is still not in the signal set.
