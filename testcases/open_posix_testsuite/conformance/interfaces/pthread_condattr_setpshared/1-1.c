 * Test that pthread_condattr_setpshared()
 *
 *  It shall obtain the value of the process-shared attribute from 'attr'.
 *
 * Explanation:  To share a mutex between 2 processes, you need to map shared memory for
 * the mutex.  So whether the 'type' of the condattr is shared or private, it really will
 * not make a difference since both processes will always have access to the shared memory
 * as long as they the pointer to it.  So all we check here is that you can actually call
 * the pthread_condattr_setpshared() function, passing to it PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED and
 * PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE.
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1.  In a loop, initialize a pthread_condattr_t object with pthread_condattr_init()
 * 2.  Set 'pshared' of the object to PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE using pthread_condattr_setpshared
 * 3.  Call pthread_condattr_getpshared() to check if the process-shared
 *     attribute is set as PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE.
