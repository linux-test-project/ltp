   The function
     int pthread_condattr_setpshared(pthread_condattr_t *attr,
                                     int pshared);
  shall set the process-shared attribute in an initialized attributes object
  referenced by attr.

  The process-shared attribute is set to PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED to permit a condition
  variable to be operated upon by any thread that has access to the memory where the
  condition variable is allocated, even if the condition variale is allocated in memory
  that is shared by multiple processes.  If the process-shared attribute is set to
  PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE, the condition variable shall only be operated upon by threads
  create within the same process as the thread that initialized the condition varible; if
  threads of differing processes attempt to operate on such a condition variable, the
  behavior is undefined.

  If successful, the pthread_condattr_setpshared() function shall return zero;
  The pthread_condattr_setpshared() function may fail if:
    [EINVAL] The value specified by attr is invalid.

             for that attribute.
