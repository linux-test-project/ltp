  <assertion id="1" tag="ref:XSH6:34787:34790">
	The pthread_rwlock_tryrdlock( ) function shall apply a read lock as in the
	pthread_rwlock_rdlock( ) function, with the exception that the function shall fail
	if the equivalent pthread_rwlock_rdlock( ) call would have blocked the calling thread.
	In no case shall the pthread_rwlock_tryrdlock( ) function ever block; it always either
	acquires the lock or fails and returns immediately.
  </assertion>

  <assertion id="2" tag="ref:XSH6:34798:34800">
	The pthread_rwlock_tryrdlock( ) function shall return zero if the lock for reading on
	the read-write lock object referenced by rwlock is acquired. Otherwise, an error number
	shall be returned to indicate the error.
  </assertion>

  <assertion id="3" tag="ref:XSH6:34802:34804">
	The pthread_rwlock_tryrdlock( ) function shall fail if:
	[EBUSY] The read-write lock could not be acquired for reading because a writer holds
	the lock or a writer with the appropriate priority was blocked on it.
	The function shall not return an error code of [EINTR].
