 * Test that pthread_rwlock_tryrdlock(pthread_rwlock_t *rwlock)
 *
 *	The pthread_rwlock_tryrdlock() function shall apply a read lock as in the
 *	pthread_rwlock_rdlock()
 *	function, with the exception that the function shall fail if the
 *	equivalent pthread_rwlock_rdlock()
 *	call would have blocked the calling thread. In no case shall the
 *	pthread_rwlock_tryrdlock()
 *	function ever block; it always either acquires the lock or fails and
 *	returns immediately.
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1.  Initialize a pthread_rwlock_t object 'rwlock' with pthread_rwlock_init()
 * 2.  Main thread read lock 'rwlock'
 * 3.  Create a child thread, the thread read lock 'rwlock' using pthread_rwlock_tryrdlock(), should success
 * 4.  Main thread unlock 'rwlock'
 * 5.  Main thread write lock 'rwlock'
 * 6.  Create child thread to read lock 'rwlock' with pthread_rwlock_tryrdlock(), should not block and get EBUSY
 * 7.  Main thread unlock 'rwlock'
