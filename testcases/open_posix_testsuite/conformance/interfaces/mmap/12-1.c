 * The mmap() function shall add an extra reference to the file
 * associated with the file descriptor fildes which is not removed
 * by a subsequent close() on that file descriptor.
 * This reference shall be removed when there are no more
 * mappings to the file.
 *
 * Test Steps:
 * 1. Create a file, while it is open call unlink().
 * 2. mmap the file to memory, then call close(). If mmap() add
 *    extra reference to the file, the file descriptor will not be removed.
 * 3. Try to open the file, open should success;
 * 3. munmap the mapped memory;
 * 4. Try open the file again, should get ENOENT;
