 The resulting set shall be the union of the current set and the signal
 set pointed to by set, if the value of the argument how is SIG_BLOCK.

 Steps:
 1. Have main create a new thread and wait for its termination.
 2. Inside the new thread, set up the signal mask such that it contains
    only SIGABRT.
 3. Also inside the new thread, using the SIG_BLOCK as the value to
    pthread_sigmask's first parameter, add SIGALRM. Now both signals
    should be in the signal mask of the new thread.
 4. Raise both signals make sure that the handler associated with these
    signals wasn't executed.
 5. Also make sure that both signals are pending.
 6. Pass one of three return codes to the main() function:
    - A value of -1 if one of the two signals wasn't found pending or
      causes the handler to be executed.
    - A value of 0 if both signals were infact pending and the handler
      wasn't executed.
    - A value of 1 incase of any UNRESOLVED situation such as an
      unexpected function failure.
