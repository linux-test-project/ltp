 * Test that pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol()
 *
 * Sets the protocol attribute of a mutexattr object (which was prev. created
 * by the function pthread_mutexattr_init()).
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1. In a for loop, call pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol with all the valid 'protocol' values.
 * 2. In the for loop, then call pthread_mutexattr_getprotocol and ensure that the same
 *    value that was set was the same value that was retrieved from this function.
