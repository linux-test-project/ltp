 * Test that pthread_setspecific()
 *
 * shall associate a thread-specific value with a key obtained via a previouse call to
 * pthread_key_create.  Different threads may bind different values to the same key.
 * Calling pthread_setspecific with a key value not obtiained from pthread_key_create of after
 * the key has been deleted with pthread_key_delete is undefined.
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1.  Create NUM_OF_KEYS pthread_key_t objects
 * 2.  Set each key to a thread-specific value with pthread_setspecific()
 * 3.  Call pthread_getspecific() on each key and check that the value returned is correct.
