 * Test that pthread_setspecific()

 * shall acssociate a thread-specific value with a key obtained via a previouse call to
 * pthread_key_create.  Different threads may bind different values to the same key.
 * Calling pthread_setspecific with a key value not obtiained from pthread_key_create of after
 * the key has been deleted with pthread_key_delete is undefined.
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1.  Create a key
 * 2.  Bind a value from the main thread to this key
 * 3.  Create a thread and bind another value to this key
 * 4.  Compare the values bound to the key between the main thread and the newly created thread,
 *     they should be different and pertaining to what each thread set as the value.
