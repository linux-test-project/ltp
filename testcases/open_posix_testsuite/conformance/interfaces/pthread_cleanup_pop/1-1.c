 *  void pthread_cleanup_pop(int execution);
 *
 * Shall remove the routine at the top of the calling thread's cancelation cleanup stack and
 * optionally invoke it (if execute is non-zero).
 *
 * STEPS:
 * 1. Create a thread
 * 2. The thread will push a cleanup handler routine, then call pthread_cleanup_pop, setting
 *    'execution' to a non-zero value (meaning the cleanup handler should be executed)
 * 3. Verify that the cleanup handler was called.
