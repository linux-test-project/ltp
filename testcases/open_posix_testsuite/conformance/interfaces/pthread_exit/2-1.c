 * Test that pthread_exit()
 *
 * Any cancelation cleanup handlers that have been pushed and not yet popped
 * shall be popped and executed in the reverse order that they were pushed.
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1.  Create a new thread.
 * 2.  The thread will call pthread_exit().
 * 3.  When this happens, the cleanup handler should be called.
 * 4.  Main will test that when pthread_join allows main to continue with the process that
 *     the thread has ended execution.  If the cleanup_handler was not called, then the
 *     test fails.
