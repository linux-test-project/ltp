 * Test that pthread_exit()
 *
 * terminates the calling thread and makes the value 'value_ptr' available
 * to any successful join with the terminating thread.
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1.  Create a new thread.  Have it return a return code on pthread_exit();
 * 2.  Call pthread_join() in main(), and pass to it 'value_ptr'.
 * 3.  Check to see of the value_ptr and the value returned by pthread_exit() are the same;
