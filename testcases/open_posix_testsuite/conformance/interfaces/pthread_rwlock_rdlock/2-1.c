 * Test that pthread_rwlock_rdlock(pthread_rwlock_t *rwlock)
 *
 * 	If the Thread Execution Scheduling option is supported,
 *	and the threads involved in the lock are executing with the
 *	scheduling policies SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR, the calling thread shall not
 *	acquire the lock if a writer holds the lock or if writers of
 *	higher or equal priority are blocked on the lock;
 *	otherwise, the calling thread shall acquire the lock.
 *
 * In this case, we test "higher priority writer block"
 *
 Steps:
 * We have three threads, main(also a reader), writer, reader
 *
 * 1.  Main thread set its shcedule policy as "SCHED_FIFO", with highest priority
 *     the three: sched_get_priority_min()+2.
 * 2.  Main thread read lock 'rwlock'
 * 3.  Create a writer thread, with schedule policy as "SCHED_FIFO", and priority
 * 	using sched_get_priority_min()+1.
 * 4.  The thread write lock 'rwlock', should block.
 * 5.  Main thread create a reader thread, with schedule policy as "SCHED_FIFO", and
 *     priority sched_get_priority_min()
 * 6.  Reader thread read lock 'rwlock', should block, since there is a higher priority
 *     writer blocked on 'rwlock'
 * 7.  Main thread release the 'rwlock', the writer should get the lock first
