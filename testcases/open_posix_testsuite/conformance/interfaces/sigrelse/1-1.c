 * Steps:
 * 1. Set up a handler for signal SIGABRT, such that it is called if
 *    signal is ever raised.
 * 2. Call sighold on that SIGABRT.
 * 3. Raise a SIGABRT and verify that the signal handler was not called.
 *    Otherwise, the test exits with unresolved results.
 * 4. Call sigrelse on SIGABRT.
 * 5. Verify that the handler gets called this time.
