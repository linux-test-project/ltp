 * Test pthread_once()
 *
 * The pthread_once() function is not a cancelation point.  However if
 * 'init_routine'is a cancelation point and is canceled, the effect on
 * 'once_control' shall be as if pthread_once() was never called.
 *
 * STEPS:
 * 1. Create a cancelable thread.
 * 2. In the thread routine, call pthread_once using a global pthread_once_t
 *    object.
 * 3. Cancel the thread during the pthread_once init function
 * 4. Call pthread_once again with the same pthread once_t object
 * 5. This should call the pthread_once init function.  If not, the test fails.
