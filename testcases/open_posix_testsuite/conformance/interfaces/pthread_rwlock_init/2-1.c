 * Test pthread_rwlock_init().
 *
 *	If attr is NULL, the default read-write lock attributes shall be used;
 *	the effect is the same as passing the address of a default read-write
 *	lock attributes object.
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1.  Initialize a pthread_rwlock_t object 'rwlock' with pthread_rwlock_init(),
 *     set 'attr' as NULL.
 * 2.  Create a child thread, the thread lock 'rwlock' for reading, shall not block.
