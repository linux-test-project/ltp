CPT If _POSIX_CPUTIME is defined, implementations shall support
clock ID values obtained by invoking clock_getcpuclockid( ),
which represent the CPU-time clock of a given process.
Implementations shall also support the special clockid_t value
CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID, which represents the CPU-time clock of
the calling process when invoking one of the clock_*( ) or timer_*( )
functions. For these clock IDs, the values returned by
clock_gettime( ) and specified by clock_settime( ) represent
the amount of execution time of the process associated with the clock.
