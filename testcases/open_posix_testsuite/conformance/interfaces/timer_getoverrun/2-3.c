 * Test that timer_getoverrun() returns the number of overruns that
 * have happened due to signals being sent from a timer.  Test with
 * timer seconds in smallest possible increments.
 *
 * valuensec = clock resolution
 * intervalnsec = 2*valuensec
 * expectedoverruns = (1,000,000,000 - valuensec) MOD intervalnsec
 *
 * Steps (testing with just one overrun):
 * - Block signal SIGCONT (SIGCONT used so test will not terminate)
 * - Set up a timer to send SIGCONT on expiration with an interval
 *   of intervalnsec nanoseconds.
 * - Wait for that timer to expire expectedoverruns+1 times
 *   (Sleep for valuensec + (expectedoverruns)*intervalnsec).
 * - Call timer_getoverrun() and ensure expectedoverruns was returned.
 *   [First signal made it.  All others were overruns.]
 *
 *   12/17/02 - Added Jim Houston's patch.  There is a chance that additional
 *   timer expires can happen before the overrun count is gotten, so this
 *   test stops the timer before that can happen.
 *
 *   04/29/2004 - adam.li
 *   - Add test for RTS option
 *   - It seems disalarm the timer before calling timer_getoverun() will discard
 *     previous overrun (when testing on libc-2004-04-29
 *   - Make itvalue = 1 sec.
