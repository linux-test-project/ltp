  The function
    int pthread_mutexattr_destroy(pthread_mutexattr_t *attr)

  destroys a mutex attributes object; the object becomes, in effect,
  uninitialized. An implementation may cause pthread_mutexattr_destroy()
  to set the object referenced by 'attr' to an invalid value.

  *NOTE: What the last sentence states is implementation specific, thus
  it will not be covered.

  A destroyed 'attr' attributes object can be reinitialized using
  pthread_mutexattr_init(); the results of referencing an 'attr'  object
