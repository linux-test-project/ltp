 * Test that if clock_settime() changes the value for CLOCK_REALTIME,
 * an absolute timer which would now have expired in the past
 * will expire immediately (with no error).
 * Test with a repeating absolute timer and set the clock forward past
 * > 1 expirations of that timer.
 *
 * Steps:
 * - get time T0
 * - create/enable a timer to expire at T1 = T0 + TIMEROFFSET and repeat
 *   at interval TIMERINTERVAL
 * - set time forward to T1 + EXPECTEDOVERRUNS*TIMERINTERVAL
 * - ensure that timer has expired with no error
 * - ensure that the overrun count is EXPECTEDOVERRUNS
 *   * Note:  The POSIX spec is unclear what exactly the overrun count
 *            should be in this case.  It is only speculation that it ==
 *            EXPECTEDOVERRUNS.  Either way passes.
