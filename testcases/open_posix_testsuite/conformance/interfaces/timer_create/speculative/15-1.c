 * Test that timer_create() sets errno to EAGAIN if the system doesn't
 * have enough queuing resources to honor this request or the creation
 * of the timer would exceed the allowable timers that the calling process
 * can create.
 *
 * Finding the true limits of the system would be a stress test, so this
 * test will make a best attempt by going up to TIMER_MAX.  If this
 * does not work, test will output PASS and say that results were
 * inconclusive.
 *
 * For this test, signal SIGALRM will be used, clock CLOCK_REALTIME
 * will be used.
