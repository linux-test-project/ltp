 * Test that pthread_self()
 *
 * Shall return the thread ID of the calling thread.  No errors are defined.
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1.  Create a new thread.
 * 2.  The function that the thread calls will call pthread_self() and store
 *     the return value (which is the thread ID of the thread calling it) into
 *     a global variable.
 * 3.  Call pthread_equal and verify that the thread IDs are the same.
 * 4.  Verify that the new thread ID is not the same as main thread ID.
