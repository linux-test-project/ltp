 * Test that pthread_create() creates a new thread with attributes specified
 * by 'attr', within a process.
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1.  Create a new thread that will go into a never-ending while loop.
 * 2.  If the thread is truly asynchronise, then the main function will
 *     continue instead of waiting for the thread to return (which in never
 *     does in this test case).
 * 3.  An alarm is set to go off (i.e. send the SIGARLM signal) after 3
 *     seconds. This is done for 'timeing-out' reasons, in case main DOES
 *     wait for the thread to return.  This would also mean that the test
 *     failed.
