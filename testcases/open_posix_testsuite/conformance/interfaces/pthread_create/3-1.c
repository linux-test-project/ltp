 *  Test if the attributes specified by 'attr' are modified later, the thread's
 *  attributes shall not be affected.
 *  The attribute that will be tested is the detached state.
 *
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1.  Set a pthread_attr_t object to be PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE.
 * 2.  Create a new thread using pthread_create() and passing this attribute
 *     object.
 * 3.  Change the attribute object to be in a detached state rather than
 *     joinable.
 * 4.  Doing this should not effect the fact that the thread that was created
 *     is joinable, and so calling the functions pthread_detach() should not fail.
