 *  Test If 'attr' is NULL, the default attributes shall be used.
 *  The attribute that will be tested is the detached state, because that is
 *  the only state that has a default listed in the specification.
 *
 *  default: PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE
 *  Other valid values: PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED

 *
 * Steps:
 * 1.  Create a thread using pthread_create() and passing 'NULL' for 'attr'.
 * 2.  Check to see if the thread is joinable, since that is the default.
 * 3.  We do this by calling pthread_join() and pthread_detach().  If
 *     they fail, then the thread is not joinable, and the test fails.
