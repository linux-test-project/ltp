 * Test pthread_create()
 * The thread is created executing 'start_routine' with 'arg' as its only
 * argument.
 *
 * Steps:
 * 1.  Create a thread using pthread_create() passing to it an array of 'int's as an argument.
 * 2.  Use that passed int argument in the thread function start routine  and make sure no
 *     errors occur.
