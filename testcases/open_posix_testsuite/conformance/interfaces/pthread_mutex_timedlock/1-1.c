 * Test that pthread_mutex_timedlock()
 * locks the mutex object referenced by 'mutex'.  If the mutex is
 * already locked, the calling thread shall block until the mutex becomes
 * available.  The wait will end when the specified timeout time has expired.

 * The timeout expires when the absolute time 'abs_timeout' passes, or if 'abs_timeout'
 * has already been passed the time of the call.

 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Create a mutex in the main() thread and lock it.
 * 2. Create a thread, and call pthread_mutex_timedlock inside of it.  It should block for
 *    the set time of (3 secs.).
 * 3. Save the time before and after the thread tried to lock the mutex.
 * 4. After the thread has ended, main() will compare the times before and after the mutex
 *    tried to lock in the thread.
