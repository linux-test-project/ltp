BOUNDARY TESTS
==============
It is sometimes useful to test parameter boundaries as part of API testing.
In the POSIX Test Suite Framework, variables cannot be assigned to values that
would cause warnings (because warnings are treated as errors), so the following
list of boundary values has been created for boundary testing.

These boundary values are those values that the gcc compiler would set an
invalid parameter to during compile time:

INT32_MAX+1       -2147483647 (gcc compiler gave -2147483648)
INT32_MIN-1        2147483647
unassigned val    -1073743192
unassigned val     1075002478

Potentially the MAX+1/MIN-1 values are deterministic.  The others are just
empirical examples.
