This document describes the process for reporting bugs found _by_ the
POSIX Test Test Suites.

A future document will cover how to report bugs found _within_ the
POSIX Test Test Suites.

This document describes the steps we'd like to take to ensure we are finding
new, important issues and reporting them in a clear, consice, and effective
manner.

1.  Bug is found - i.e., Test case shows failure.
    Ensure you were testing using:
    - The latest version of the test case.
    - The latest version of the code under test.
    - Code under test that is targeted* for the POSIX Test Suite reporting.
2.  Research.
    Research as many of the following areas as possible to ensure the bug
    is new:
    - Mailing list for the code under test.
    - Bug database for the code under test.
    - LKML - (one archive:  http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel)
    - Kernel bug database - http://bugme.osdl.org
3.  Debug as much as possible.
    Some steps include:
    - Create a test case which clearly shows the bug.
    - If possible, find the fault in the code under test causing the test case
      failure.
    - If possible, create a patch to fix the fault.
4.  If the code under test is compatible with another POSIX version (e.g.,
    1993), then determine whether this test case is for functionality
    added by the 2001 spec.
    If yes, document this in the assertions.xml file**.
5.  Create an email bug report containing:
    - description of the issue
    - kernel used
    - patches applied
    - relevant configuration information
    - hardware used
    - test case to reproduce the issue (can be included in the email)
6.  Send email bug report to the mailing list for the code under test (or
    its bug database, if applicable).  Copy LKML, if applicable.  [If it
    is a bug in the Linux Kernel, submit directly to the Linux Kernel
    bug database.]

*targeted implementation = an implementation which POSIX Test Suite will
be run against; not yet formally defined
**Process for tracing a test case to previous POSIX specifications not
yet defined.
