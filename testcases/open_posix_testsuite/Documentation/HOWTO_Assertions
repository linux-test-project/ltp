ASSERTIONS
==========

This document defines the format of assertions as well as the information
contained in the XML parameters.

Format
------
The general format of an assertion is:
<assertion id="<#>" tag="<string>">
</assertion>

ID
--
The ID is a unique number corresponding to the test case number (see the
README for more information).

Tag
---
The tag uses the conventions defined below.

The format of the tag is below.
Items in <> are replaced with the correct values.
Items in [] are optional.
()+ means the pattern can repeat and occurs at least once
(<type>:<source>:<start line>:<last line>)+ [pt:<POSIXtag>]

type - Refers to the type of source that the assertion was taken from.
       Valid values are:
          ref - For reference document (generally a POSIX specification)
          oth - For any other material (design documents, analysis of
                                        behavior, etc.)

source - Refers to the source that the assertion was taken from.  Valid
         values are:
            For ref:
             (Note: # refers to the document version number)
               XBD#   - POSIX Base Definitions document
               XSH#   - POSIX System Interfaces document
               XCU#   - POSIX Shell and Utilities document
               XRAT#  - POSIX Rationale document

	       When dealing with Technical Corrigendums, append TC# where # refers to
		the technical corrigendum document number.

		e.g.  XSH6TC1,  XBDTC2, etc.

            For oth:
               user defined - Ideally should be short (1-3 letters) to define the
                              source.

start line/ - Refers to the first and last line in the source where the
last line     assertion is taken from.  If the type is oth and there are no
              line numbers, this should be the page number (or 0 if no
              page numbers).

              Note:  If you do not have access to the line numbers in
                     the official POSIX Specs, then simply put in
                     brackets an unofficial reference
                     (ex. <section 3.4, third bullet>)

pt:<POSIXtag> - If the assertion is taken from a POSIX specification and there
                is a POSIX tag (pt) associated with it, the additional string
                pt:<POSIXtag> can designate this.  <tag> is the three letter
                POSIX tag.
