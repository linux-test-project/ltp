1. Overview
------------
This document describes how to run the tests in the POSIX Test Suite.

Our framework currently has the ability to build and run conformance,
functional, and stress tests.  All tests are built with make all, but
certain care should be used when running the stress test suite as the
tests may leave the system in an indeterminate state.

2. Framework Functionality
----------------------------------------------------

  * Conformance Tests
The build and execution process varies for conformance tests.

For definitions tests, the build and execution process is the same since
the pass/fail criterion is determine by whether or not the test compiles.
A definitions test will be compiled, not linked, by the toolchain.

For all other tests, they will have one test for the compile, one for the
link, and one for the execution of the test.  Successful tests return
PTS_PASS, which the interprets as success.  All other return values are
considered failures [For more info, see HOWTO_ResultCodes].

  * Functional/Stress Tests
Functional and stress tests have their own Makefile and method for running,
and the framework merely calls these mechanisms.  To build functional and
stress tests, the framework calls the main Makefile for each functional
area.  To run these tests, the framework calls the run.sh file for each
functional area.

3. Building and Running the Tests
----------------------------------

** See the BUILD file for info on how to set up the build for the specific
area you are testing (threads, mqs, semaphores, etc.), as well as setup the
build specific to your environment.

To build and run the tests, you should be in the main posix test suite
directory.

From there, execute:
    # ./configure
    # make all

This will build all of the conformance, functional, and stress tests.

To disable known failures on Linux do make filter-known-fails.

* Conformance-specific items *

To run conformance tests for a specific directory, just cd to the directory
and run make all test.

Example:
    # cd conformance/definitions/time_h ; make all test

To just build conformance tests, run:
    # make conformance-all

To just run conformance tests, run:
    # make conformance-test

* Functional/Stress-specific items *

To run only functional tests, run:
    # make functional-test

To run only stress tests, run:
    # make stress-test

To make only functional tests, run:
    # make functional-all

To make only stress tests, run:
    # make stress-all

To skip known failures on Linux, run:
    # make filter-known-fails
    # make test

4. Running POSIX Option Group Feature Tests
-----------------------------------------------------

There are several POSIX option groups available that can be tested with this
test suite. The available groups are:

	AIO	| Asynchonous I/O
	MEM	| Memory
	MSG	| IPC
	SEM	| Semaphores
	SIG	| Signals
	THR	| Threading
	TMR	| Timers
	TPS	| Thread Execution Scheduling

You can run the tests by executing:

	bin/run-posix-option-group-test.sh [OPTION-GROUP]

or run all of the tests by executing:

	bin/run-all-posix-option-group-tests.sh

More details about these features can be found on the OpenGroup site
(http://www.opengroup.org).
