RESULT CODES
============

POSIX Test Suite tests all return standard result codes for ease in
interpreting the output.  The result code terms are taken from
IEEE Test Methods for Measuring Conformance to POSIX (IEEE 1003.3-1991).
These result codes are a subset of the LSB result codes and, for
consistency with LSB, are given the same number.

The PTS result codes are:

#define PTS_PASS        0
#define PTS_FAIL        1
#define PTS_UNRESOLVED  2
#define PTS_UNSUPPORTED 4
#define PTS_UNTESTED    5

A brief discussion of each of these follows:

PTP_PASS	Used when the test executes fully with no problems and passes.
PTP_FAIL	Used when the test executes fully, but fails.
PTP_UNRESOLVED	Used when the test was blocked from fully completing and
		the pass/failure results cannot be determined.
PTP_UNSUPPORTED	Used if the test is for a conditional feature that is
		not implemented.
PTP_UNTESTED	Used when a feature does not have a test associated
		with it because:
		- The test is just a stub and doesn't do anything
		- The test is only partially complete and can't really
		  finish the test
		- The test is complete in some cases, but certain things
		  can happen that leave the test incomplete.  When these
		  happen, it's PTP_UNTESTED.

These result codes are contained in the header file posixtest.h, located
in the include/ directory.

This header file should be included in each test suite created.
