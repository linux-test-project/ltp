HOWTO Release a Package of the POSIX Test Suite
===============================================

This document describes the procedure for releasing files for the POSIX
Test Suite.  These actions should be taken to verify the integrity of the
released files.

=======================================================================

1.  Pull all code on the developer tag and tag with the release tag (See
    the HOWTO_Tagging document for more information on how to do this.).

2.  Create a posixtestsuite-<major>.<minor>.<rev>.tar.gz file containing
    everything with the release tag.
    Note:  Follow guidelines on:
    http://en.tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-Release-Practice-HOWTO/distpractice.html

3.  Use the SF admin interface to add this file to the project.

4.  Download the *.tar.gz file from the SF interface and untar it in
    a sandbox.

5.  Run "./configure && make" to try to build and execute all files
    in the release, and ensure that they all build and execute correctly.

6.  Craft a release message and send to:  posixtest-announce.

7.  Send a copy of that release message to:  LKML, cc:  posixtest-discuss.
    [This ensures discussions happen on the discuss mailing list, not
    the announce mailing list.]

8.  Update sourceforge homepage and project page with this information.

9.  Update freshmeat.net with this information.
