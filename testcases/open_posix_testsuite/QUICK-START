QUICK-START
***********

So you're in a hurry and don't feel like reading all those docs in the Documentation section that we have worked so hard to write huh?

No worries! Here's a quick doc to help you around POSIX** Test Suite.

========================
Setting up your machine
========================

* There is nothing to install, the suite is intended to be run directly.

* See the "BUILD" file for info on how to set up the Makefile and your machine,
  depending on what specific area you are concentrating on.
(Signals, Semaphores, Threads, Timers or Message Queues).

===================
Running the tests
===================

* Easiest way to run all the tests is to do a "make all" in the top-level
  directory.

* To run tests for a specific directory, do the following
  - make generate-makefiles # only required for the first shot.
  - cd <subdir> ; make all test

  Example:

  - make generate-makefiles
  - cd conformance/interfaces/pthread_create ; make all test

* Running tests for a specific focus can be done like so:
  run-posix-option-group-test.sh [OPTION-GROUP]

* For additional information on how to build and run the tests in this
  suite, see Documentation/HOWTO_RunTests.

BUILD			- describes how to set up your developer machine to build and test

The following files give developers information on how to write test
cases for the project (under Documentation):

HOWTO_Assertions    	- describes format of the assertions files used to
                       	map test case descriptions to test cases
HOWTO_BoundaryTest    	- information about testing boundary conditions
HOWTO_CodingGuidelines	- describes coding guidelines for this project
HOWTO_Coverage        	- describes format of COVERAGE.<area> files
HOWTO_DefinitionsTest 	- ideas behind testing POSIX header files
HOWTO_ResultCodes     	- standardized return codes for tests
HOWTO_Tagging         	- describes how to tag files for inclusion in a release
