----------------------------------- COMPILATION -----------------------------------
We are doing our best to ensure the test case will be very portable.
Please report any problems on the forum (see on top of this file)


 * Flags
You may want to add -DVERBOSE=2 to have verbose tests,
or -DVERBOSE=0 to have silent tests (for batchs for example).

You may add -DWITHOUT_XOPEN to disable the XSI features
from the tests. Some of the tests won't work with this option.

You may want to add -DSCALABILITY_FACTOR=X, where X is an integer,
to change the stress programs load (default is 1).

You may want to add -DPLOT_OUTPUT if you want data for plotting.

 * Commands
Compilation under linux:
gcc -o <bin> -lpthread -lm -lrt <source>
   where <bin> is the executable you want to build and <source> is the source file.

 * Execution
This case will possiblly run for half an hour.
If you want diagrams showing the result:
a. Add -DPLOT_OUTPUT flags when compiling
b. ./s-c > data
c. ./do-plot data
This script will use gnuplot to create a png file named scalable.png.

(If your gnuplot does not support png terminal, just remove
set term png
set output "scalable.png"
from the do-plot script).

Stress tests will run until they are killed with SIGUSR1 (or they
fail). Currently, I do
$> ./stress &
and then after a while
$> kill -USR1 <pid>
or
$> for PR in `ps o pid --no-headers -Cstress`; \
   do echo Sending SIGUSR1 to pid $PR...; \
       kill -USR1 $PR; \
   done;
Some cases will keep on executing ~ 1 minute after they receive the
signal; it is normal (time for stopping all threads).
