 * This file is a wrapper to use the tests from the NPTL Test & Trace Project
 * with either the Linux Test Project or the Open POSIX Test Suite.

 * The following macros are defined here:
 * UNRESOLVED(ret, descr);
 *    where descr is a description of the error and ret is an int (error code for example)
 * FAILED(descr);
 *    where descr is a short text saying why the test has failed.
 * PASSED();
 *    No parameter.
 *
 * Both three macros shall terminate the calling process.
 * The testcase shall not terminate without calling one of those macros.
 *
