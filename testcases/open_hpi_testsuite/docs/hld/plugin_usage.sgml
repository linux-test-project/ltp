  <title>OpenHPI Plugin Usage</title>
  <para>
    This chapter is an overview of the existing plugins for OpenHPI,
    and how one needs to configured them for usage.  It is expected
    that this will grow over time as new plugins are added.
  </para>
  <sect1>
    <title>General Configuration</title>
    <para>
      To add a plugin for usage by OpenHPI one has to add at least 2
      stanzas to the <literal>/etc/openhpi/openhpi.conf</literal>
      file.  These are a <literal>plugin</literal> and
      <literal>handler</literal> stanza.  An example configuration
      file is shown below.
    </para>
    <para>
  <programlisting role="config">
# Sample /etc/openhpi/openhpi.conf
# comments start with # character

plugin libdummy

handler libdummy {
          entity_root = "{ROOT,0}{SYSTEM_CHASSIS,2}"
}          

plugin libsnmp_bc

handler libsnmp_bc {
          community = "mypass"
          host = "10.0.0.1"
          entity_root = "{ROOT,0}{SYSTEM_CHASSIS,0}"
}

handler libsnmp_bc {
          community = "mypass"
          host = "10.0.0.21"
          entity_root = "{ROOT,0}{SYSTEM_CHASSIS,1}"
}
  </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      The <literal>plugin</literal> stanza tells OpenHPI that there is
      a plugin file of the name libsnmp_bc.la in the
      LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH that it should load on startup.  This path
      defaults to /usr/lib:/usr/local/lib.
    </para>
    <para>
      The <literal>handler</literal> stanza creates and instance of an
      OpenHPI plugin.  It includes a block stanza which lets the
      plugin take those configuration stanzas that it wishes, and use
      them for instantiation.  At minimum, the entity_root must be
      specified to instruct OpenHPI where in the Entity hierarchy the
      entities discovered by the handler should go.
    </para>
  </sect1>
  <sect1>
    <title>Dummy Plugin</title>
    <para>
      The Dummy Plugin is a test plugin that was first used to test
      the infrastructure.  It is still useful for testing a new
      feature in the infrastructure without having hardware supported
      by OpenHPI.
    </para>
    <sect2>
      <title>Prerequisites</title>
      <para>
        None.  The dummy plugin consists of static data specified
        within the plugin.  It requires no special hardware or
        software to run.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>Configuration</title>
      <para>
        There is no required configuration for the dummy plugin (I
        know this isn't true, but I'll leave this for someone else to write).
      </para>
    </sect2>

  <sect1>
    <title>SNMP Blade Center Plugin</title>
    <para>
      The SNMP Blade Center plugin is an SNMP based interface to IBM's
      Blade Center hardware.  Technical information about Blade Center
      is best found at <ulink
        url="http://www-1.ibm.com/servers/eserver/bladecenter/"
        >the Blade Center Home 
        Page</ulink>.
      
    </para>
    <para>
      This plugin is called <literal>snmp_bc</literal> in the OpenHPI tree, and will be
      referenced by the name <literal>libsnmp_bc</literal> in all
      OpenHPI configuration files.
    </para>
    <sect2>
      <title>Prerequisites</title>
      <para>
        The snmp_bc plugin is not currently built by default in the
        OpenHPI build process.  In order to enable the building of the
        snmp_bc module one must add the configure flag
        <literal>--enable-snmp_bc</literal> during the configure
        process.
      </para>
      <para>
        snmp_bc relies on Net-SNMP >= 5.0.  most testing has
        been done with >= 5.0.7 so the latest version available for
        your distribution is recommended.
      </para>
      <para>
        The Blade Center hardware must also be SNMP enabled to
        interface with this plugin properly.  This requires that the
        Management Module firmware be >= 1.0.4.  As of the time of
        this writing 1.0.6 is available and can be found at
        <ulink
          url="http://www-3.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/document.do?lndocid=MIGR-45487"
          >the IBM Support Site</ulink>.
        Instructions are included there for upgrading the firmware.
      </para>
      <para>
        Once the firmware is updated, one must use the Management
        Module web interface to enable SNMP access.  This is found
        under the Networking options in the web interface.  There is a
        field to both set the community string (i.e. password) and up
        to 3 allowed hosts to connect to the Management Module.
        Ensure that what host will be running OpenHPI is in that list
        of allowed hosts.
      </para>

handler libsnmp_bc {
          community = "myc0m"
          host = "192.168.64.52"
	  entity_root = "{ROOT,0}{SYSTEM_CHASSIS,0}"
}

  <sect1>
    <title>Watchdog Timer Plugin</title>
    <para>
      The watchdog timer plugin provides OpenHPI access to the software
      watchdog timer "softdog" in the Linux kernel.
    </para>
    <para>
      The watchdog plugin follows the standard plugin naming conventions.  It
      is called <literal>watchdog</literal> in the OpenHPI tree and should
      be referenced using <literal>libwatchdog</literal> in OpenHPI configuration
      files.
    </para>
    <para>
      The watchdog plugin code can be tested using <literal>examples/list_resources.c
      </literal> as well as <literal>examples/test_watchdog.c</literal> run as root.
    </para>
    <sect2>
      <title>Prerequisites</title>
      <para>
        As with other plugins, the watchdog plugin needs to be enabled during
        the OpenHPI build process via the configure flag <literal>
        --enable-watchdog</literal> when running ./configure.
      </para>
      <para>
        The watchdog plugin relies on the softdog functionality, which must be
        compiled as a module in the Linux kernel (tested with 2.6 kernel).
      </para>
      <para>
        After the watchdog is compiled, it needs to be inserted using <literal>
        insmod softdog [soft_noboot=1]</literal> as root.  The <literal>
        soft_noboot=1</literal> option can be used during testing so that the
        meachine does not reboot.
      </para>
      <para>
	The watchdog module should be created using <literal>mknod /dev/watchdog 
        c 10 130</literal> as root.

    <title>Sysfs Plugin</title>
    <para>
      The sysfs plugin provides access to the devices on the i2c bus that are
      exposed by sysfs.  This plugin uses libsysfs to access the sysfs data.
    </para>
    <para>
      The sysfs plugin follows the standard plugin naming conventions.  It
      is called <literal>sysfs</literal> in the OpenHPI tree and should
      be referenced using <literal>libsysfs</literal> in OpenHPI configuration
      files.
    </para>
    <para>
      The sysfs plugin code can be tested using <literal>examples/list_resources.c
      </literal> and <literal>examples/set_resources.c</literal>.
    </para>
    <sect2>
      <title>Prerequisites</title>
      <para>
        As with other plugins, the sysfs plugin needs to be enabled during
        the OpenHPI build process via the configure flag <literal>
        --enable-sysfs</literal> when running ./configure.
      </para>
      <para>
        The sysfs plugin in OpenHPI release 0.4 and later relies on libsysfs 
        0.3.0 (found in sysutils 0.3.0) 
        <ulink
          url="http://linux-diag.sourceforge.net/Sysfsutils.html"
          >on the Linux Diagnostic Tools project page</ulink>.
      </para>
      <para>
        The sysfs plugin in release 0.3 relies on libsysfs 0.2.0 (found
        in sysutils 0.2.0) 
        <ulink
          url="http://linux-diag.sourceforge.net/Sysfsutils.html"
          >on the Linux Diagnostic Tools project page</ulink>.
        Source code for the sysfs plugin that works with libsysfs 0.2.0
        can be retrieved from OpenHPI cvs using the tag libsysfs0_2_0.
        libsysfs0.2.0 has two bugs that need to be fixed before using the
	OpenHPI sysfs plugin.  Applying the two patches below (separate, sorry!)
	will fix these.  Both issues are fixed in libsysfs 0.3.0.
