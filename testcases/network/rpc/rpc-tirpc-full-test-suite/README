This test suite aims to test RPC & TI-RPC under Unix and Linux OS. For
more details, please report to the online documentation (see address above).

-------------------
Directory structure
-------------------

	scripts -> all scripts needed to launch tests cases
	inc -> system files for this test suite
	tests_pack -> all test suite program (C sources and binaries)
	logs -> directory where logs files are saved
	tsLogParser -> all what you need to use tsLogParser with that test suite

-----------
Preparation
-----------
You need one, two or three computers, all computers need ssh to run
test suite correctly and public keys MUST be shared between computers.
It is REQUIRED ssh is used WITHOUT passwd. 
Use ssh-keygen to do that.


------------------
Quick installation
------------------

To install and configure your Test Suite, run in a terminal :
 	
	./configure.auto
	or
	./configure.interactive
     
This will configure the way to run test suite (computer IP, login)

 	make deploy 
	make all

Now your test suite is ready to use

-----------------
Launch Test Suite
-----------------

* To start all tests of this test suite :

 	./rpc_ts_wizard.sh -all 

* Or, run a part of the test suite in interactive mode :

	./rpc_ts_wizard.sh

this will ask you the part of tests suite you want to test such as RPC, TI-RPC...

* Or, run manually a part of test suite
 
	./rpc_ts_run.sh -l <script_lib.sh> [-l <script2_lib.sh> ...]

this will run all tests of script <script_lib.sh>" script_lib.sh are in the test suite root directory,
use ls *_lib.sh to display them
Remark : replace <script_lib.sh> by script lib name like domain_subdomain_test_lib.sh 
         where domain is RPC or TIRPC, subdomain is i.e. stdcall, toplevel... and test is test
         category such as basic, stress...

-------------------------
Launch Test Suite Scripts
-------------------------
	To run with defaults values (`hostname` for the client ,  RHOST env variable or `hostname`) 
	./run_rpc_tirpc_test_auto.sh
	or
	run_rpc_test_auto.sh
	or
	run_tirpc_test_auto.sh

	To select and run the tests with choiced values:
	./run_rpc_tirpc_test_interactive.sh

	To run at runtest directory level:
	./runltp -f rpc
	or
	./runltp -f tirpc
	or
	./runltp -f rpctirpc
	
-------------
Tests results
-------------
After test suite has run, you will find all results in logs directory of the suite.
File rpc_ts.log contains all results. Note that this file and this test suite is fully
compliant with tsLogParser project (http://tslogparser.sourceforge.net/index.php)

More information
----------------
Please refer to Test Plan document (documentation/RpcTestPlan_v13.pdf) for more details on how to use
this test suite and refer to Test Design document (documentation/RpcTestDesign_v13.pdf) for more details
on what is tested by this test suite.
