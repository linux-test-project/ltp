NOTE:

  These tests ALL assume that the "RHOST" and "LOCALDIR" variables is set to
  the hostname of the remote machine, and a local directory name that will be
  used to NFS mount.

    # export RHOST=<hostname here>.
    # export LOCALDIR=<dir name>
	[NOTE! do not give absolute path, just give a name, like eg: testdir]
  Also, on the remote server which has the NFS directory exported, it is
  assumed that the directory has at least a gig of space.

These tests also assume an identical path tree for their location on the remote
machine.  So if pan's root path is "/home/ltptests" on the test machine, then
it must also be located in "/home/ltptests" on the remote machine (RHOST).

You will also need to setup a ".rhosts" file in root's home directory on the
remote machine, with the name of the local machine listed.  For example, if
machineA is running the tests, with machineB set as RHOST, then machineB's
root home directory will need an ".rhosts" file with machineA's hostname listed.

  I apologize for the lengthy setup, but I tried to make it as minimal as
  possible.
