#  FILE   : rlogin
#
#  PURPOSE: Tests the basic functionality of `rlogin`.
#
#  SETUP: The program `/usr/bin/expect' MUST be installed.
#         The home directory of root on the machine exported as "RHOST"
#         should have a ".rhosts" file with the hostname of the machine
#         where the test is executed, OR the "PASSWD" section below MUST
#	  be uncommented and set.
#
#  HISTORY:
#    03/01 Robbie Williamson (robbiew@us.ibm.com)
#      -Ported
#
#
# rlogin perform a rlogin session to each host in HOST_LIST with user
#    RUSER for a count of LOOPCOUNT and does an ls -l /etc/hosts to
#    verify that the rlogin was established.
