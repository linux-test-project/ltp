Controller Area Network (CAN) is a slow (up to 1Mbit/s) serial communications
protocol which was developed by Bosch in 1991, mainly for automotive, but now
widely used in marine (NMEA2000), industrial, and medical applications. More
information on the CAN network protocol family PF_CAN is contained in
<Kernel/Documentation/networking/can.txt>.
