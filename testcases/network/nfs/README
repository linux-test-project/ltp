NOTE:

  These tests ALL assume that the "RHOST" variable is set to the hostname
of the remote machine, i.e.

    # export RHOST=<hostname here>.


These tests also assume an identical path tree for their location on the remote
machine.  So if pan's root path is "/home/ltptests" on the test machine, then
it must also be located in "/home/ltptests" on the remote machine (RHOST). You
also need to do a make and make install on both the local and remote machines
before you run the test.

 You will also need to setup a ".rhosts" file in root's home directory on the
remote machine, with the name of the local machine listed.  For example, if
machineA is running the tests, with machineB set as RHOST, then machineB's
root home directory will need an ".rhosts" file with machineA's hostname
listed. After you create the .rhost file you must also set the proper
permissions on the .rhost file.  chmod 600 .rhosts

I apologize for the lengthy setup, but I tried to make it as minimal as
possible.
