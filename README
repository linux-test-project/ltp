Linux Test Project
------------------

Linux Test Project is a joint project started by SGI, OSDL and Bull developed
and maintained by IBM, Cisco, Fujitsu, SUSE, Red Hat, Oracle and others, that
has a goal to deliver tests to the open source community that validate the
reliability, robustness, and stability of Linux.

The LTP testsuite contains a collection of tools for testing the Linux kernel
and related features. Our goal is to improve the Linux kernel and system
libraries by bringing test automation to the testing effort. Interested open
source contributors are encouraged to join the project.

Warning!
--------
Be careful with these tests!

Don't run them on production systems. Growfiles, doio, and iogen in particular
stress the I/O capabilities of systems and while they should not cause problems
on properly functioning systems, they are intended to find (or cause) problems.

Developers corner
-----------------

Before you start you should read following documents:

* doc/test-writing-guidelines.txt
* doc/build-system-guide.txt

these two should contain all information needed for modifying or creating LTP
testcases. If something is not covered there don't hesitate to ask on the LTP
mailing list.

Also note that these documents are available online at:
