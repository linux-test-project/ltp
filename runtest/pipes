#DESCRIPTION:IPC pipes stress
# These tests use tests/pipeio to put pipes (named or unnamed) through a workout
#
pipeio_1 pipeio -T pipeio_1 -c 5 -s 4090 -i 100 -b -f x80
# spawns 5 children to write 100 chunks of 4090 bytes to a named pipe
# using blocking I/O
#pipeio_2 pipeio -T pipeio_2 -c 5 -s 4090 -i 100 -f x80
# spawns 5 children to write 100 chunks of 4090 bytes to a named pipe
# using non-blocking I/O
# This test hits EAGAIN, which pipeio doesn't handle at the moment
pipeio_3 pipeio -T pipeio_3 -c 5 -s 4090 -i 100 -u -b -f x80
# spawns 5 children to write 100 chunks of 4090 bytes to an unnamed pipe
# using blocking I/O
pipeio_4 pipeio -T pipeio_4 -c 5 -s 4090 -i 100 -u -f x80
# spawns 5 children to write 100 chunks of 4090 bytes to an unnamed pipe
# using non-blocking I/O
pipeio_5 pipeio -T pipeio_5 -c 5 -s 5000 -i 10 -b -f x80
