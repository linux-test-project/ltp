 pounder starts.  It also adds "lspci" into the PCI Device Tree heading per 
 user request. 
 get_hw_info

-Since 2.6.17, _syscall* isn't exported into the user space any more, so all 
 the test cases using _syscall* will fail to be compiled This patch

 also includes some cleanups and makes the build cleaner and removes the 
 warning for 
 scsimain.c, llseek.c, scsimain.c

 setrlimit01.c


-The random syscall generator has a bug on x86-64 where it only generates 
 random bits for the upper 32 bits of the syscall argument, and then truncates
 the upper 32 bits anyway!  This patch replaces the rand() weirdness with a 
 function that generates N bytes of random data instead. It also adds a -z 
 flag in case one *wants* the zero-arguments behavior; Max Asbock and Russ 
 Weight requested it because zero is a quick way to find kernel code paths
 that don't check userland pointers.

 heap. 
 shmt09.c

-Made changes to avoid hardcoding test count 
mkdir03.c, open08.c

-Changed the test to account for SLES 10.  Now the syslog tests will test 
 syslog-ng or syslogd depending on which one is present.  The update was     
 made for syslog01 - syslog10. 

-Corrected the copyright information to reflect SGI, instead of Cray, which
 was purchased by SGI years ago for files get_high_address.c, search_path.c

-Removed the Ping test. The ping test is now skipped on SLES, but does not 
  affect the execution of the rest of the test in mc_commo	

-Using syscall() rather than _syscall#() macros for the following files:
  sysfs01.c, sysfs02.c, sysfs03.c, sysfs04.c, sysfs05.c, sysfs06.c,

wait402.c, setpriority04.c,Makefile, getsid02.c

-A fix to remove extraneous include 
swapon02.c

- mc_cmds had two fixes.  The test now uses [ae]th[01] in the ping command 
using the -I option. Also the loop to determine which ethernet interface 
is needed was moved to ensure that the correct ethernet interface was selected.

-A patch was addded that allows the following files to get the PID_MAX value 
from /proc/sys/kernel/pid-max: 
access05.c, fcntl15.c, gethostid01.c, lstat02.c, mknod06.c, setrlimit02.c,

 - A fix submitted for make_tree.c by Jacky Malcles that fixes this
   testcase by setting envp
  - A fix submitted to Jacky Malcles that fixes read_checkzero.c.  The lseek
   function allows the file offset to be set beyond the end of the existing
   end-of-file of the file.  If data is later written at this point,
   subsequent reads of the data is in the gap returns bytes of zeros until
   data is actually written into the gap.
 - In the testcase semget05.c the value of MAXIDS was changed for the specific
   machine by reading the system limit for SEMMNI - The maximum number of
   semaphore sets. This is a fix for bug 24745
 - A fix submitted by Amit K. Amora that initializes the alarm received
   code and allows the test to pass more than just once on 2.6.17-rc6
   alarm05.c,
 - A fix was submitted by Andy Echols for pan.c to fix an infinite
   loop problem that occurs  in pan if runltp tries to run a test
   that isn't present.
 - A fix was submitted to cast TEST_RETURN to gid_t to avoid implicit casts
   which tend to cause problems with the testcase  setregid03.c,
 - A patch submitted by Jacky Malcles that fixes the problem where
   i0_getevents() return value is not checked and may return 0 if
   no events are available and may generate a SIGSEGV in the testcase
   aiodio_append.c,
 - Backed out the _USC_LIB change for several Makefiles because it was
   breaking on the PowerPc platform on Fedora Core
 - Added code to ignore looking for PID_MAX on powerpc, s390, and i386 to
   fix build problems on newer kernel versions on the following files:
    sysctl05.c, setpriority04.c sysfs01.c, sysfs02.c, sysfs03.c, sysfs04.c,
    sysfs06. getdents01.c, sysctl03.c getsid02.c, sysctl01.c,wait402.c
 - TCP.c was changed to delete broken whitespace and also the call for
   accept(2) takes a socklen_t, not an int
 - Changes were added to the following files to use memset() instead of
   bzero():
   tlibio.c, write_log.c, doio.c, iogen.c, fsstress.c, fsx-linux.c,
   pthcli.c, pthserv.c, pth_str01.c, pth_str03.c, recvmsg01.c, sendmsg01.c,

   network stress tests. 
-  A change submitted by Liang Shuang that fixes su01_su for the arm 
   architecture
LTP-20060615
-Added a patch from Darrick Wong to reduce the memory requirements of 
 pounder's ramsnaketes
-Added a patch for crash01.c from Olof Johansson <olof@lixom.net>
 POWER5 has coherent icache, but POWER4, PPC970 and some other processors
 lack it. The standard dcbst/icbi/isync is needed to avoid using the not
 so random (or stale) data instead.
-Test.h was moved to common headers to eliminate the need for every test file to
 declare Tst_count extern
-Usctest.h was changed to eliminate scope issues when actually using TEST()
-Added a patch from Mike Gahangan to clean up a makefile with an extra build 
 target variable.  
-Added a patch from Issac Wilcox that can keeps the test from returning a false
 failure

 and setresuid03  to pull the [gs]etre* prototypes from headers rather than 
 defining them ourself
-Made changes to setreuid01,setreuid02,setreuid03,setreuid04,and setreuid05
 to use uid_t instead of int where appropriate
- Added a change to getpriority01 to combine the TEST_RETURN and TEST_ERRNO 
  if check so that we always display PASS or FAIL messages as pointed out 
  by Isaac Wilcox
- Added a patch to make the output of fork07 deterministic.
  Specifically, make sure stdout is flushed before forking 100 times,
  else you can get 101 copies of the output.  This only seems to happen
  if glibc notices that stdout is a regular file, but in my test setup
  stdout is always redirected to a file and compared with something.
-Changed the declaration for setup and cleanup from extern in the 
 following files:

 alarm01,chdir02,chown01,close08,creat09,dup0,dup04,execl01,execle01,execlp01,
 execv01,execve01,execvp01,fchmod01,fchown01,fcntl02,fcntl03,fcntl04,fcntl05,

  system, it the max number guaranteed.  Thus, if the system actually
  allows more, the test case doesn't produce the expected failure.
- test3 in setrlimit02.c:Test attempts to increase hard limit of RLIMIT_NOFILE resource.
  The rlim_max used by setrlimit() is expected to be greater than current hard limit to get EPERM.

- Fixed ftp01 and telnet01 seems designed to run with non-root user connection
  when the user name is set to RUSER environment variable.
  However, it is incomplete.ftp01 creates a directory whose permission is root.

  can build and execute the test without it now.
- Change for defect 13778, when the /var/log/messages file is first moved, the first write fails
- The SIGINT sighandler will set the "intinitr" flag to 1 for the children. But if the
  "runtime" is small( a command line argument passed, the testcases were running
  for 5 secs here), it may happen that the SIGINT may be recieved before the
  child initialize the flag to 0, and which may lead to a hang
- Change to exclude lib6 directory from default build since it breaks earlier Distros
- Added code to handle cases where certain distros don't define AI_V4MAPPED in /usr/include/netdb.h
