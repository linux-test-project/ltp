Subrata Modak <subrata@linux.vnet.ibm.com> replied: This will fail for all POWER machines which are not P6 & above, and, for all other archs. However, for other archs, it will throw you appropriate message like: 
$./testcases/bin/endian_switch01 
endian_switch01    1  CONF  :  This system does not support running of switch() syscall
In P6 (and above), even it will fail if the kernel is not 2.6.26 & above. The support for this syscall was added only from then. Please see: http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=745a14cc264b1832c638e41812e0cb04328b2db1. If you are running 2.6.26 on p6, then we need to investigate why this is failing, else, i would prefer to merge the following patch for avoiding to test in systems where the switch() support is not available at the first place itself.

Subrata Modak replied: Thanks Németh for the patch. I tested the build on my machine 2.6.27, x86_64. I have merged this Patch. However, i would request you to send me another patch containing the following information: 
1) Kernel config options to be enabled & any special library(s) to be installed to allow these tests to be built/run on kernel(s) > 2.6.25 in the following README: http://ltp.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ltp/ltp/README, 
2) Then, http://ltp.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ltp/ltp/testcases/kernel/device-drivers/nls/README, should contain information to build/install/run these tests. Since these are device drivers tests, and will be executed through insmod, etc, can we have a script which automates these steps and reports error in loading/unloading of modules as such. I think it can be a very small script as well. 
Németh Márton responded by: I added some descriptions in the mentioned READMEs. However, I would wait adding an automated shell script because the tests fails on my x86_32 system with 2.6.28, and for example "rmmod nlsTest" reports "ERROR: Module nlsTest is in use". The real problem is, however, that the one of the test case already caused NULL pointer exception. I also don't have any easy solution to report only the nlsTest output to the user other than first running "dmesg -c" and then load nlsTest.ko. After the module was loaded the "dmesg" will only show the output of the testsuite. The drawback is that the user will loose the first part of his/her "dmesg" in this way.

This patch fixes fcntl27 and fcntl28 test cases failures seen on RHEL 4 kernel (2.6.9 based).
# ./fcntl27
fcntl27     1  FAIL  :  fcntl(tfile_1206, F_SETLEASE, F_RDLCK) failed with errno 11 : Resource temporarily unavailable

It because the expected result in incorrect. There is a kernel version comparison code in both tests.
    if ((results=tst_kvercmp(2,6,10)) >= 0)
          {
            expected_result = -1;
          }
    else if( ((results=tst_kvercmp(2,4,0)) >= 0)&&\
             ((results=tst_kvercmp(2,6,0))< 0) )
      {
            expected_result = 1;
      }
    else if( ((results=tst_kvercmp(2,6,0)) >= 0)&&\
         ((results=tst_kvercmp(2,6,10))< 0) )
      {
            expected_result = 0;
      }
    else
      {
             expected_result = -1;
      }

Because it is kernel 2.6.9, the "expected_result" will be 0. However, th actual return code is the same as other kernels like 2.6.18, as it only allow F_RDLCK option to be placed on a read-only file descriptor (man fcntl). 
# strace ./fcntl27 
...
open("tfile_1453", O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0777) = 3
...
fcntl(3, 0x400 /* F_??? */, 0)          = -1 EAGAIN (Resource temporarily unavailable)

I have no idea where is the above kernel version and expected code mapping originally came from. I have searched the manpage of fcntl(), but not found any mention of 2.6.10. Since there is a check already, #ifdef F_SETLEASE I have removed the above code like other fcntl* test cases, but I am willing to listen other options. Signed-off-by: CAI Qian <caiqian@cclom.cn>.

The following mail archive tells that it can be a kernel driver problem: http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_name=48F4CFF7.8070303%0terra.com.br. It seems there is some modification between 2.6.23 and 2.6.24-rc1 which raise this problem. Looking at the git log of file drivers/char/tty_ioctl.c there are few commits between these two releases (3 to be exactly, and one of them is a typo):
tty: expose new methods needed for drivers to get termios right:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=5f519d728169fa9975bcba001de425f11e18e8e3,
tty_ioctl: fix the baud_table check in encode_baud_rate:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=75e8b71d559632dd70c9799ea8b5c133a2ddcea9,
Somebody says: The ltp-list thread referenced seems to imply that the new functionality is correct and that the relevant LTP test needs to change, whereas others disagreed: Afaics, the ltp-list thread didn't conclude if the testcase should be fixed or if there's a problem in the kernel tty modification. Beyond this, there is this comment from Alan Cox on commit 5f519d728169fa9975bcba001de425f11e18e8e3 (mainly the last 3 paragraphs), mentioning that he was expecting some "tweaking" until the drivers were fixed. However, i tried to set only the HUPCL | CREAD | CLOCAL bits, still the tests failed for 2.6.27 kernels. So, i have prepared 2 patches: 
1) PATCH 1: Patch to Find the core problem with ioctl02: (This is for demonstration and not to be applied)
This clearly demonstrates that something goes wrong when: ioctl(parentfd, TCGETA, &termio) gets called. It alters the value of c_cflag. However other flags´ values remain unchanged:
# ./ioctl02 -D /dev/tty0
ioctl02     0  INFO  :  Trying to the Set the value of c_cflag, present value of c_cflag=0 
ioctl02     0  INFO  :  Trying to the Set the value of c_cflag, value of c_cflag to be set to=5641
ioctl02     0  INFO  :  After Setting the value of c_cflag, value of c_cflag=5641
ioctl02     0  INFO  :  Before Calling ioctl(parentfd, TCSETA, &termio), the value of c_cflag, value of c_cflag=5641
ioctl02     0  INFO  :  After Calling ioctl(parentfd, TCSETA, &termio), the value of c_cflag, value of c_cflag=5641
ioctl02     0  INFO  :  Before Calling ioctl(parentfd, TCGETA, &termio), the value of c_cflag, value of c_cflag=5641
ioctl02     0  INFO  :  After Calling ioctl(parentfd, TCGETA, &termio), the value of c_cflag, value of c_cflag=4277
ioctl02     0  INFO  :  cflag has incorrect value. 4277  
ioctl02     1  FAIL  :  TCGETA/TCSETA tests FAILED with 1 error 
ioctl02     0  INFO  :  child: Got SIGTERM from parent.
2) PATCH 2: Patch to Remove Checking for "termio.c_cflag": The only way Test can handle this to make it pass is to avoid checking for this flag which is causing the trouble, which this patch does: 
# ./ioctl02 -D /dev/tty0
ioctl02     0  INFO  :  termio values are set as expected
ioctl02     1  PASS  :  TCGETA/TCSETA tests SUCCEEDED
ioctl02     0  INFO  :  child: Got SIGTERM from parent.
However, i still believe that there is something to be fixed from the kernel side, rather than from the test side, although this patch will make the test PASS for the time being. And i will not have any problem applying this patch. Signed-Off-By: Subrata Modak<subrata@linux.vnet.ibm.com>.

This patch fixes the syslog tests on Debian. The tests currently fail on Debian, because they check for a nonexistent file. Besides that, this patch adds rsyslogd as another possibility to supported syslog daemons.

This patch fixes the problem by properly expressing the build depdency between the TARGET objects and runcc.a. Signed-off-by: Matt Helsley <matthltc@us.ibm.com>.
Garrett Cooper <yanegomi@gmail.com> replied: Sorry to knitpick, but runcc.a should really be librunc"c.a; otherwise it's not really linkable with ld when using -lruncc. You could also omit the lime with CC if implicit rules are enabled. Other than that the patch looks groovy!.
Matt Helsley replied back: Since the -l flag is not being used to link with runcc.a that's not a problem. -l adds the naming requirement and searches multiple directories. Otherwise gcc behaves as if it were just another .o. I think the only reason to prefer -l is if we're going to install it as a library. I checked and, as best I could tell, runcc.a is only used in the network/lib6 testcases. This means using -l has no advantages so I don't intend to change this part of the patch. In fact I can't see why they bothered making an archive at all. But that's a different change than I intend to make :). I guess I never relied much on the implicit rules -- I suppose the implicit rule compiling and linking each target will be triggered because the "empty" rule: 
$(TARGETS): %: %.c runcc.a
did not actually wind up creating its supposed target.. Thanks for the review. I'll post an updated patch soon. This patch fixes the problem by properly expressing the build depdency between the TARGET objects and runcc.a. Rely on the implicit rules as suggested by Garrett Cooper.

8) Log Message:
These patches enable AIO and listio in tlibio.c for linux, mostly by reusing code that is already in tlibio.c, and makes non-blocking read()/write() actually work. Also, they change pipeio.c to use this. Comments:
1) Patch 0001 enables aio and other types of io in tlibio.c code. Note that this means programs using functions from tlibio need linking with libaio and librt,
2) Patch 0002 changes non-blocking io in tlibio, so that it doesn't report EAGAIN to the client, but rather waits with select() for the io to become available (it would be possible extend this by adding more wait types). Also, it makes some minor changes to pipeio to make it work (eg. make opening the pipe always block, regardless of non-blocking setting).
3) Patch 0003 adds a semaphore to pipeio, to ensure all children have opened their pipes before reading & writing takes place. This avoids situations where one child gets to open the pipe after the parent deleted it (eg. because of an error). Also, it should eliminate all empty reads.
4) Patch 0004 changes error handling in pipeio to interpret every negative number as -errno.
5) Patch 0005 changes the way the end of the test is handled - before, the test ended after the last child was dead, but possibly before all data was read. The new way is to read all data and only if no data can be read, see if the children are dead.
The patches should be applied in sequence. Signed-Off-By: Jiří Paleček <jpalecek@web.de>,

The aiodio_sparse (and dio_sparse) tests use mmaped region of memory backed by a file, and populate the pages by writing to them. This can fail, eg. when Linux overcommits memory and the newly created pages do not fit; it results in the file not being properly deleted. This patch fixes that by trapping signals in these test (I used the standard libltp functions for that) and deleting the file in a cleanup function.

I report a bug of the msgctl02 testcase and a patch for it. When you set /proc/sys/kernel/msgmnb to a value larger than 65536, msgctl02 always results FAIL because of a bug itself. An example when /proc/sys/kernel/msgmnb == 4194304,
# cd ./testcases/kernel/syscalls/ipc/msgctl
# ./msgctl02
msgctl02    1  FAIL  :  qs_buf.msg_qbytes value is not expected
msgctl02    0  INFO  :  expected - 65535, received - 4194303
#
This is because the variable "new_bytes" storing "expected" value above is defined as "unsigned short" type and cannot hold a value larger than 65535. It should be "msglen_t" type as same as the member msg_qnum of struct msqid_ds, but msg_qnum seems to be declared as "unsigned long int" type on some architecture like ia64, I recommend you to use "unsigned long int" for new_bytes.

Veerendra <veeren@linux.vnet.ibm.com> reported: In the latest LTP release (LTP-full-20081130) the make is failing for Power machines for the 'utimensat' tests. Jiri Palecek <jpalecek@web.de> replied: This is because TCID is needed to call tst_brk if the syscall doesn't exist or optimization doesn't eliminate the call. At the first sight, it might seem that syscall() is not called when __NR_utimensat is undefined, because it is guarded by #ifdef, but it's not really so, because __NR_utimensat is stubbed in linux_syscall_numbers.h. To fix it, apply the first patch, which moves the definition of TCID outside the #ifdef block - it should be there anyway.

Version 2: The test failed a few hours after I sent this off. I think it was caused by a pid collision which caused the test to use the same queue as an earlier failed test that didn't close out its queue. This version of the test uses O_EXCL to avoid this. And it cleans up the queue on every failure case. This test was racy. It relied on signals interrupting sleeps to do syncronization between processes. It also didn't cleanup the queue on the failure cases and assumed that its queue didn't already exist. This patch fixes these issues. Reported failures: https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=375897. Instead use a syncronization pipe to have the child thread send messages to the parent thread (with reasonable timeouts since this is testing blocking calls).

This is a proposal for 2 new testcases in the pidns testcases. They are related to POSIX message queues and notification on message arrival. Could you please review them? If a process registers for asynchronous notification on a POSIX message queue, it gets a signal and a siginfo_t structure when a message arrives on the message queue. The si_pid in the siginfo_t structure is set to the PID of the process that sent the message. If the process that sent the message is not in the same namespace as the notified one, this should be taken into account. 
pidns30 : notified process is in a descendant namespace wrt to the notifier. so the signal receiver doesn't know about the sender's pid.
pidns31 : notified process is in an ancestor namespace wrt to the notifier. so the signal receiver should get the sender's PID in the signal receiver namespace.
They currently fail, since the si_pid is not correctly set. But I just proposed a patch to fix this (see http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/5/13).

Per request of Mike Frysinger, I resend this patch. The patch itself is  the same, but the explanation is extended. Hope it's better this time. 
Hello,
I'm sorry to say this, but some changes in the "Fix Warnings and Badness v2" patch[1] from October actually create bugs in the ltp tests. I think they should be reverted by applying the attached patch. The problems are of those types:
1) Calling:
pthread_create(&th, &newattr, (void *)&new_thread, (void *)&newsockfd) is wrong if eg. newsockfd is a variable subsequently modified by the parent thread, not protected by locking. This is because there is a data race between the read in the new thread and the write in the parent thread. Moreover, it is quite often meant to pass different values to more threads in the ltp tests, which results in the different threads actually sharing the variable, which leads to unpredictable results.
2) Calling
pthread_exit((void *)&exit_val); is wrong if exit_val is a local or thread-local variable, incl. errno. These variables cease to exist when the thread finishes, so subsequent dereferencing & read in the joining thread would read nonexistent variable. I think they should be reverted, because the warning (conversion pointer/integer) doesn't mean anything bad in this context (provided you use the same type on both sides, eg. the calling thread and the created thread) and other solutions just add unnecessary complexity. The patch goes a little further, while I was searching for related problems, I've found one typo and changed the signatures of some thread functions (they really should be (void* (*)(void*)), not (void* (*)(int))). I've discovered this when I debugged a deadlock in test_1_to_1_threads. BTW, shouldn't the first (or last) thread in this test call t_recv instead of t_send (see the relay function).

53) Log Message:
The problem is noticed only for these 2 tests lstat01A_64 and stat04_64. Analysis of the problem showed that these tests are called from runtest/syscall file. The problem is noticed because the symlink01.c file doesn't have implementation to take care lstat01A_64 and stat04_64 arguments that are passed in the file runtest/syscall. Solution: Simple solution is to remove lines.
lstat01A_64 symlink01 -T lstat01_64
stat04_64 symlink01 -T stat04_64
from runtest/syscall.
Other option is to provide feature in symlink01.c so that it can execute these tests successfully. I worked on one such patch. Please have a look. This runs same tests for lstat01A_64 and stat04_64 as is run for lstat01 and stat04 respectively. Signed-Off-By: Sharyathi Nagesh <sharyath@in.ibm.com>.

accept4_01 test cases are broken because the function accept04() is not implemented in testcase. Used ltp version: ltp-full-20081130.tgz. Manually executed the test as below:

Subrata Modak <subrata@linux.vnet.ibm.com> replied:
=========================================================
Fix on x86_64 as well, as it behaves properly on other Architectures. Supriya/Manas, accept4_01.c is a new test case for the new system call accept4() recently introduced in kernel-2.6.26 only for the x86_64 architecture. The test has the code to handle if it is not supported in some architecture. Interestingly it executes the expected way on x86 machines: 
# uname -a
Linux 2.6.25-gcov-nomodconfig-smp #1 SMP Thu Jun 12 06:29:27 EDT 2008 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux 
# ./ltp-intermediate-20081216/testcases/bin/accept4_01
accept04_01    1  CONF  :  syscall __NR_accept4 not supported on your arch
But on x86_64, it behaves differently:
# uname -a
Linux 2.6.18-125.el5 #1 SMP Mon Dec 1 17:38:25 EST 2008 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
# ./accept4_01
accept04_01    1  BROK  :  accept4() Error: Function not implemented
It means though the interface calls for:
syscall(__NR_socketcall, SYS_ACCEPT4, args)
&
syscall(__NR_accept4, fd, sockaddr, addrlen, flags)
will execute as __NR_socketcall & __NR_accept4 are defined inside the system, the exact implementation of the interface is yet to come as the kernel < 2.6.26. So, i changed the code accordingly. Please verify the patch. Signed-Off-By: Subrata Modak <subrata@linux.vnet.ibm.com>.

Sridhar Vinay Replied:
======================================================
Manas, This looks like default SLES behaviour. When all rules are flushed, the default behaviour for SUSE firewall is to drop all packets. This is not the case with RH where absence of any rule results in all packets accepted. So we may need to adjust the test accordingly. Modification to test case to indicate certain distributions dropping all packets when firewall is enabled and no rule is present.

And time and again i was trying to revive the device drivers tests inside LTP, but, did not get sufficient volunteers to do the same. Your test code can be a starting point for us. I downloaded your testsuite and was able to compile the stuff, with some modification(s). However, i did not test it. Can you also share the logs of the run on your machine ?? More info is required in the documentation. I have prepared a patch(attached & embedded), which will integrate these tests inside LTP with minor modifications in documentation and some #defines in some source files (to be able to compile on machines not having respective header files containing the definition). Now, we have 2 choices:
1) You can voluntarily allow us to maintain this code inside LTP. Send your patches/modifications to us, whenever you want to add/modify/remove any tests out of: ltp/testcases/kernel/device-drivers/v4l-test/, We will then do the needful. You benefit by showcasing your test code to a bigger LTP community, and hence can attract more contribution from them. We gain by re-introducing/re-starting device drivers testing, which can then move to other device drivers as well. If you agree, please reply to this mail with a DCO Sign-off:  Signed-Off-By: Németh Márton <nm127@freemail.hu>, I can then go ahead and include this patch.
2) You can keep your project running at: http://v4l-test.sourceforge.net/, as well as agree to apply this patch to include in LTP. In such a case, send us updates whenever you update your project. In any case, i  would require a DCO Sign-off: Signed-Off-By: Németh Márton <nm127@freemail.hu>,  from you. I would like to thank you for deciding to contribute this to LTP, and would also request you to help us fix the  existing device drivers tests in LTP, so that we can start using them. If necessary we can delete the obsolete ones and add new ones: http://ltp.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ltp/ltp/testcases/kernel/device-drivers/. Do you think, you will also be able to help us here ??

Yes, sorry about that. I have had no access to my emails during the last days. I also wanted to think about this a little. I would like to choose the 2nd solution: I try to run my project forward and send you patches to include them  in LTP. The source code and the test design was created by me. However, the V4L2 API specification which is also included in the tarball is only downloaded and saved under the 'doc' directory so I always have a local copy of the V4L2 API revision 0.24. This you might not want to include in the LTP source code. I had some difficulties with the inline patch you sent me, it was not usable at my side because my email client was not able to handle it correctly. Could you please send it as an attachment? What I could recognised that the v4l-test project was placed in LTP source directory under ltp-intermediate-20081223.orig/testcases/kernel/device-drivers/v4l-test . However, if I look around in the "device-drivers" subdirectory I would use the subdirectory: ltp/testcases/kernel/device-drivers/v4l/user_space . What do you think?

Always create a new expected output file, not append to the previous in gzip_tests: The expected output file in gzip_tests is made always by appending data to the file.

Amend cleanup procedure in mknod07: the cleanup in mknod07 didn't work for me, because the test yields root, removes search permission on its current directory and then tries to chdir("..") which fails due to the missing permission. This patch fixes that by re-gaining root before the cleanup.
 - restore root privileges before tmp directory cleanup. This is needed, because as nonprivileged user, we don't have search permission on the current directory,
 - because of that, do not drop root completely by setuid(), change effective uid instead,
 - call cleanup in one case when setup fails,

Syscall sched_setaffinity fails if choosen cpu is not online. In set_affinity, thread_id value is used as cpuid when calling sched_setaffinity. This fails when disabling cpus because threads ids and online cpu ids don't necessarly match. This patch simply increments cpuid (max. 8192) until it finds an online cpu.

Dimension (128) of statistics arrays must be a multiple of number of cpu. This is a hassle as you have to recompile every time your arch changes or if you want to disable cpus. Failing to do so causes segfault when requiring statistics if 128 modulo nr_cpus != 0. This patch adds option -i to specify how many iterations are wanted (still defaulting to 128). It rounds up iterations to the nearest multiple of online cpus. Signed-off-by: Gilles Carry <gilles.carry@bull.net>, Acked-by: Darren Hart <dvhltc@us.ibm.com.

The test changes the window size using the slave-fd and expects that it won't affect the window-size on master-fd. With this change, we return the slave's window size and test fails. I've no idea why anyone would have thought the existing behaviour was correct. The pty/tty pair code tries to share the size and other information at all times and the old test was I think verifying a bug existed.

We are referring to the last window size check in test2() of testcases/kernel/pty/ptem01.c. This check will cause the test to fail when some of the planned ttydev changes are merged. Would you happen to know if the check is really required or if it should be dropped ? 
Subrata Modak <subrata@linux.vnet.ibm.com> wrote: I would want the test to remain there, but introduce some checkings before running the test. As test2() is valid under present circumstances, we should retain it as people will keep using LTP on lower kernels. Having said that, i would like to come with a solution where test2() of testcases/kernel/pty/ptem01.c is not run after the planned ttydev changes are merged. Something compile/run time checking to either not to build that part of code and run it. Can we do something like that by checking some glibc/kernel exported definitions ?

Just to be clear, the entire test2() is not broken. Only the last part (see patch below) Other parts of test2() should be fine even with new changes.

when building Debian ltp package on alpha, the package failed to build, because alpha lacks some of the syscalls (the xxx_16 ones). See:
http://experimental.debian.net/fetch.php?&pkg=ltp&ver=20081031%2Bdfsg-1&arch=alpha&stamp=1225968365&file=log&as=raw
I have created some patches, which fix this behaviour (ie. the build  doesn't fail then). They work like this:
1. Syscalls which are potentially missing on some architectures are listed in the stub-list,
2. If a syscall(x) is called and x is 0 (a value of undefined stub syscalls), the test is aborted by tst_brk(). This is accomplished by a macro wrapper over the syscall() function (this almost eliminates the need of changing the tests in question, and allows the compiler to eliminate parts of tests of nonexistent syscalls as dead code). The attached patches implement this. Some remarks:
- the syscalls added to the stub list are the ones which appear in the kernel sources as __IGNORE_name-of-syscall,
- the macro is for gcc only. The test using this mechanism (ie. #including linux_syscall_numbers.h and calling syscall()) must define static function void cleanup(void) to be called when the syscall is missing (the patch also handles this for tests that lack it).

Unfortunately, when you mmap using the MAP_FIXED flag, you can overwrite an existing mmap in the address space.  Please do the following to check if this has happened:
1. Insert a 'getchar();' call above line 155 in the test source code above and recompile the test.
2. Run the test.  When it pauses (waiting for input at the getchar() call), hit <ctrl>-z to background the test.
3. Determine the pid of the test case using ps
4. Collect the /proc/<pid>/maps for the appropriate pid
5. Paste that output here in this bug.

My suspicion is confirmed.  This is a LTP test case bug.  All of the above mappings will have been overwritten by the mmap call on the hugetlbfs file at address 0.  This will most certainly cause your program to crash and burn. To fix the test case, I would recommend removing the MAP_FIXED flag from that mmap call and checking the address you get from mmap.  If it's zero, you'll know a mapping could be created at the bottom of the address space.  If it's -1, the mmaping failed. But if it's >0, you'll have to decide how to handle the case where the mapping could not be placed in the spot you requested. This case would not be a failure, just a failure to test the scenario you wanted to test.  I assume the LTP test harness has a way to represent an insignificant test result.  You might just treat this case in the same way you handle mmap() == 0.

Initial Porting of accept4() syscall test to LTP by Subrata Modak <subrata@linux.vnet.ibm.com>. Originally written by Michael Kerrisk <mtk.manpages@gmail.com>. Later modified to suite compilation on different systems by Jiri Palecek <jpalecek@web.de>, who wrote the following:
I have some nitpicks, in decreasing severity: First, the syscall, I believe, is not targeted at i386 and x86-64 only. Therefore, it is not wise to have these explicitly mentioned in the code. Also, it would be better not to "#error" if the arch isn't one of those fortunate, because ltp should build on others too. This should be fixed by patch 1. Disclaimer: This patch should make it compile (and fail at runtime with TCONF) on all kernels that don't have the syscall, and actually run the test on all kernels that do, depending on kernel headers version. However, I didn't test this (especially the selection of the syscall), so it needs to be checked. Second, if any of the syscalls vital for the test fails, it's preferable to output the error message too, and call tst_brk() for cleanup (patch 2). Third, there it would probably be better to use TFAIL/TPASS for recording success and failure instead of manual boolean flags (patch 3). Last, I think a successful test should print as little as possible and multiline messages like "calling syscall..." are really not that useful. Patch 4 disables them.

The test case gtod_latency in realtime causes soft lockups on some machines. This is because the test hogs the cpus for a long time, because it's main loop runs at SCHED_FIFO, 99. We have seen soft lockups mainly on LS20 machines (x86_64, Opterons). The following patch introduces a sleep after some iterations of the test. This ensures that the test doesn't hog the cpu completely and hence avoids soft lockups. 
Testing done:
Compiled with the patch and observed that the soft lockups are gone. Also observed that the latencies are not affected. In fact latencies improve with this patch on most hardware.

The file testcases/kernel/include/stub-list was recently removed. It contained the list of syscall numbers which, if not present in the kernel headers or in one of the architecture-specific lists, should be defined as 0 (a stub value). Now, this list is automatically generated as union of the architecture-specific lists. However, some syscalls only appeared in stub-list, which means they are not stubbed now, so architectures lacking them will probably fail to build (alpha...). To overcome this, I have added these syscalls to the i386 list, which means they will be defined whenever they are defined in the kernel sources, on i386, and stubbed otherwise. See the attached patch. BTW, the list of syscalls is not exhaustive. In the attachment filtered-syscalls, there is a list of syscalls which appear as __IGNORE_syscall-nr in the kernel sources (which means they are missing on some architecture), but are not used in ltp or their use is guarded by an #ifdef. They would have to be added too, if some test explicitely mentions them (eg. getresgid16). Signed-off-by: Jiri Palecek <jpalecek@web.de>.

Fix busy loop in realtime:
The routine busy_work_us(), which is the busy work loop function in realtime test suite is supposed run for as many microseconds as requested for. However, I have observed that it runs too fast on some hardware. I looked at the code and saw that we are statically setting the loop counters, which means the duration of the busy loop varies with the cpu speed. Further, the busy loop is affected by compiler optimizations. On some hardware it provides only 50% of requested delay, whereas with -O3, it finishes even faster. What we need is a method to dynamically tune the delay loop based on the machine where the test is being run. It should not be affected by compiler optimizations as well.

CONTROLLERS: Modify test to reflect kernel MAX_SHARES limit: The tests takes too long if we keep the time interval 60 seconds. Hence changing to 30 seconds. Also the kernel has now the max linit on shares values (1UL <<18). So taking readings upto 7th set will reach the max limit very soon(specialy on high end machines). Therefore we keep the multiplier to multiply at max 4 times. Hence we will reach till GROUP_NUM * 10^4. Signed-off-by: Sudhir Kumar <skumar@linux.vnet.ibm.com>.

Re-enablement of TI-RPC tests to build/install/run in LTP:
Le Rouzic <aime.le-rouzic@bull.net> wrote: I get a first patch to deliver which improves the Sun-RPC and TIRPC Test Suite. The Sun-RPC tests part works quite well. About the TIRPC I still have some FAILED I am working on that I will fix in a second patch. There is no much time now for the November delivery so let me know if you want me to deliver right now the first patch.
Subrata Modak <subrata@linux.vnet.ibm.com> replied: I am not worried if the test case(s) of TI-RPC fails. The point is they should be able to build, install and run - irrespective of whether many of the tests fail. The issue(s) like linking to proper libraries while building and finding those libraries to run should be properly resolved. If they require specific libraries to to build/run, that should be properly documented. Users should be able to find those libraries and install them (if it does not come with the system in first place), so that they can start using those tests. If people can start using those tests, then there will be more people who can help fix issues related to tests themselves. It would be nice if you can send a patch (against latest CVS) which would re-enable the TI-RPC tests to build/install/run in LTP properly. We can see the test fails later.

Vinay Sridhar <vinay@linux.vnet.ibm.com> replied:
I looked through the iptables test. It fails because of mismatch in the number of chains after firewall is enabled. Under RH, enabling firewall adds a new chain to the "filter" table and under SLES, 3 new chains are added.  This patch can change this test accordingly.

Hi Andrea, As you are using myfunctions.sh in your script, it will simply replace the installed myfunctions.sh in $LTP_ROOT/testcase/bin which is written by Sudhir. And if you will run this testcase from `./runltp` sudhir's memory controller tetscase will refer your myfuncitons.sh script. So i am just renaming this script to some other name and correspondingly changing the Makefile & run_io_throttle_test.sh . Attached is the patch. I might require your acknowledgement for this.

lcov: geninfo chokes on spaces in the directory name

From: Jeff Connelly <jeffconnelly@users.sourceforge.net>

In lcov 1.6, geninfo fails to find gcno/gcda files if the source directory has spaces in the name, because it uses backticks to shell out to "find", passing $directory on the command-line. Attached is a patch that double-quotes the variable, allowing geninfo to operate on directories with spaces in their name. The fix isn't perfect; it won't work on directories with a " character, but it works fine for my purposes (I don't have any directories with quotes). A better fix would be to use IPC::System::Simple's capturex from http://search.cpan.org/~pjf/IPC-System-Simple-0.15/lib/IPC/System/Simple.pm #runx(),_systemx()_and_capturex(). capturex() is a multiple-argument form of the backticks, so it avoids any interpolation errors.

12) Log Message:
If we unshare pidns without unsharing mounts namespace, and then do a mount -t proc none /proc, then the new proc sits over the original proc for the whole system. Since pidns03 wasn't using CLONE_NEWNS, when it exited /proc showed zero tasks.  This can be fixed by doing 'umount -l /proc', but 'umount /proc' is insufficient.  More to the point, pidns03 wasn't trying to clean up /proc at all.  So make it use CLONE_NEWNS so its private procfs will be automatically cleaned up. Signed-off-by: Serge E.

The new ltp-full-20080930.tgz seems to include some new ptrace tests (ptrace04 and ptrace06) that do a #include for spawn_ptrace_child.c. Now I find that if I do a "make clean" it removes this spawn_ptrace_child.c ... is this expected and desired? Also is there supposed to be a way to generate the spawn_ptrace_child.c and any other files removed after "make clean" ? Thanks, - Mark Ver.
Yes, I believe it's an error. The spawn_ptrace_child.c file is necessary to ptrace04 and ptrace06. To do a #include *.c file is not a good coding style. The simplest solution is to rename the spawn_ptrace_child.c to spawn_ptrace_child.h. Also you can add __inline__ as the prefix of functions, then the spawn_ptrace_child.h file looks more like a header file. Thanks, - Jin Bing Guo.

18) Log Message:
With Exec-Shield in place, the Kernel automatically adjusts the stack downward by a random amount of bytes. This will cause the test failed occasionally on IA-32, because the 11th requested chunk of address space (bfe00000-bff00000) has already been used by the stack. For example, stack could be at bfe0b000-bfe20000, and then, shmat(2) failed, mykey to uniquely identify the shared memory segment 0x451005ae. Get shared memory segment (1048576 bytes). Attach shared memory segment to process: ERROR [line: 205] shmat failed - return: 0xffffffff: Invalid argument. It looks like the stack adjustment has a range that it could be chosen, so I changed the start of 11th address space to a lower address. Tests showed that the stack will not go downward that much. In addition, there are a few minor fixes, - keep the width of comments within 72 characters. - remove unnecessary 0x prefix. Signed-off-by: CAI Qian <caiqian@cclom.cn>.

This patch fixes build failures seen on RHEL 4 (2.6.9 based Kernel), and several warnings. The build failures are caused by pec_listener.c and then ptrace06.c, It because the Kernel version checking code is incorrect from it, as you can see from the error message above, "/bin/sh: ../../bin/tst_kvercmp: No such file or directory". I solve it by querying an entry in proc file system instead. For ptrace06.c case, PTRACE_GETSIGINFO and PTRACE_SETSIGINFO are unavailable in this version of Kernel, Given that this test also fails to compile for IA-64 entirely (please see more details on one of my previous emails sent not long ago), I disable this test temperately until those problems have been fixed.

40) Log Message:
Logfiles of the ltp testdriver "runltp" can get corrupted due to "unsafe" temporary directories and not failing when temporary already exist. The temp directory is /tmp/ltp-$$ which can cause logfile corruption once the PID overflows, since "mkdir -p" will NOT fail, and runltp starts writing into an already existing log directory. This patch creates a temporary directory by using "mktemp", which replaces the "mkdir -p" call. runltp will fail once "mktemp" runs out of combinations (instead of corrupting logfiles silently). Patch is based on the idea from Erik Hamera to create more "safe" temp directories. Various patch improvements/fixes got contributed by Klaus Wagner as well.

- the testXX functions don't recurse nor call each other,

Replacement of deprecated interfaces: The update_refpolicy.sh fixes some of deprecated interfaces and inject an interface to kick test script from unconfined domain. So, I can run the testsuite which includs bounds test without any problems on Rawhide. However, I got some warnings for deprecated interfaces/macros like r_dir_perms, userdom_sysadm_bin_spec_domtrans_to or userdom_use_sysadm_ptys. The attached patch is a new test case of the boundary feature, which contains six tests, as follows: 
test01: It tries to invoke setcon() with bounded domain in a multi-threaded process. The expected result is success.
test02: It tries to invoke setcon() with unrelated domain in a multi-threaded process. The expected result is fail.
test03: It makes a bounded domain try to read a file, when its bounds domain can read the file. The expected result is success. test04: It makes a bounded domain try to write a file, when its bounds domain cannot write the file. The expected result is fail, because write permission is boundary violated.
test05: It tries to write a bounded type, even if the domain cannot write to its bounds type. The expected result is fail. 
test06: It makes a bounded domain try to set an attribute of bounded type.Thanks,

Garrett, thank you for input. I think my patch works as you wrote. My patch tries sys/signalfd.h then linux/signalfd.h. So I can say my patch tries "whatever's the newest standard"(glibc header file) then "deprecated version"(no glibc header but kernel header file). It is important point. Thank you. CROSS_CFLAGS should be considered when checking the existance of header file. I update the last patch. It does
  1. If sys/signalfd.h is not available, use syscall to invoke signalfd.
  2. CFLAGS is considered when checking the existance of signalfd.h.
  3. Checking the existance of signalfd.h in addition to checking sys/signalfd.h and linux/signalfd.h.

I was just wondering a) if that's the case, b) whether or not those affected test compiles have been identified and removed / modified? If both questions are true and no one has pointed out this issue before now, I've found all of the items which don't follow this behavior: According to the folks in #fedora-devel (airlied, jwb), we shouldn't be using asm/page.h directly, but instead should be accessing everything in page.h via sysconf(2), like so:
                PAGE_SIZE => sysconf(_SC_PAGE_SIZE)
This method is POSIX compatible as per: http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/sysconf.html.
Yes, it is. There are numerous test cases in LTP which use:
       struct dirent, 
by including /usr/include/dirent.h. The interesting part is, this guy (/usr/include/dirent.h) in turn includes /usr/include/bits/dirent.h, where the definition of struct resides. Following is the patch which solves this issue along with page.h header file removal from 2.6.25 onwards, reported by Garret earlier. Signed-of-by: Subrata Modak <subrata@linux.vnet.ibm.com>.

In hugemmap01, huge page size was defined as a macro-definition.

However different architecture may has different huge page size in kernel. Such as :
    1. http://lxr.linux.no/linux/include/asm-i386/page.h#L122
   #define HPAGE_SHIFT     22
   #define HPAGE_SIZE      ((1UL) << HPAGE_SHIFT)       // the size is 4M

    2. http://lxr.linux.no/linux/include/asm-parisc/page.h#L160
   #define HPAGE_SHIFT             22      /* 4MB (is this fixed?) */
   #define HPAGE_SIZE              ((1UL) << HPAGE_SHIFT)

    3. PPC: 16M

So read the huge page size for the kernel parameters is reasonable. The solution is to get the huge page size from the /proc/meminfo. Signed-off-by: Jin Bing Guo <guojb@cn.ibm.com>.

Intial Addition of sync_file_range() syscall test to LTP. I have developed test cases for sync_file_range() system call which will do the basic sanity (error) checking for the system call.  These tests have to be run on 2.6.17 kernel and above. The test cases have been currently tested only on x86 and x86_64 architecture. Also,  I have hard coded the system call number in the test case for  review purposes and will be later on moving it to linux_syscall_numbers.h file in the LTP framework.

This is a patch from John, written a few months back.  I have fixed up a few cosmetic whitespace bits, and have refreshed it so it should apply cleanly to LTP today. Will Schmidt <will_schmidt@vnet.ibm.com>. 

Comments originally by John Stultz:

So I've been trying to go through and review our test cases to make sure we're getting sane data and the tests are really testing what we want. Looking at gtod_latency and gtod_infinite, I was always struck that gtod_infinite always came up with much larger latencies while gtod_latency usually seemed to miss them. Main issues:
1) gtod_latency was not running for long enough, I've upped the iterations by 10x to make sure we get more solid results.
2) gtod_latency was doing too much computation between gtod calls. This means it could miss latencies that occur while it was running. I reworked the data collection loop so the un-measured window is smaller.
3) gtod_infinite was accidentally measuring its own computation in its delay, inflating its values. I cut that logic out.
4) both gtod_latency and gtod_infinite were not running mlocked. this caused background SCHED_OTHER disk access to inject delays, making the results less reliable.
 
Those four issues have been fixed, and I also converted gtod_latency to use clock_gettime() just to be consistent and to give slightly better resolution.

There are no libnuma testcases for API version 2 in ltp yet. Currently -DNUMA_VERSION1_COMPATIBILITY will not help for the LTP numa testcase, since the compability interface is missing some interface from version 1: Fix for the VERSION1 compatibility interface got already send to linux-numa list.

Addition of getcpu() syscall to LTP. I have fixed the problem noticed earlier. Hope it will be fine this time. More over I wanted to mention that I have dropped getcpu2.c as it was found to be less relevant for getcpu() testing. Andi had made some suggestions to improve the test, I am submitting this before making all those changes. If possible I will sit and work on Andi's suggestion.

Conformance/interfaces/timer_getoverrun/2-2 has failed on tests with some distros running on ppc64 machines. As far as I could realize, it happens due to these machines are running kernel with timer frequency configured to 100 Hz, which represents a clock precision smaller than the defined INTERVALNSEC. This patch sets the interval equals to the clock precision (retrieved via function clock_getres()), in order to avoid to use a interval smaller than the resolution of the clock.

In testcases/kernel/sched/tool/time-schedule, it used kill(0, SIGTERM) to terminate the all the processes in the group. However, the progress group leader might be different regarding the different call methods. In interactive call such as pan, it called time-schedule by exec() and setpgrp() as a child process. The time-schedule process would be the process group leader and all the child processes created by it had the same PGID. So the SIGTERM was sent to process group and the exit code got by pan was 0. In non-inactive call such as STAF/STAX, one shell script called the time-schedule directly. The shell script would be the process group leader. So the SIGTERM was also sent to the shell script and the exit code got by STAF/STAX was 143 (128+15). This patch can resolve this problem.

Also, call _exit(2) from child processes which avoids the child calling the atexit functions that the pthread library setup. This fixes an issue where the pthread manager thread would begin exiting at the same time as a child thread. The child thread would run the atexit functions which cause it to wait for a signal to be sent from the thread manager. As the thread manager was trying to exit that signal would never be sent. Calling _exit(2) from the child avoids this whole mess. Matt Fleming <mjf@gentoo.org>.

When compiling powerpc binaries, gcc defaults to 32 bit. To do some tests I needed to have a 64 bit binary. Since I'm using realtime, I modified config.mk as below. My questions: is there any official way to turn LTP in 64bit? If not, what shall we do then? Should LTP default to 32 or native-arch bit? Shall we use something like: "if (uname -m) ..." or use a command line option? Any comment?
Gilles.

According to man gcc:
 -m64
     Generate code for a 32-bit or 64-bit environment.  The 32-bit environment sets int, long and pointer to 32 bits and generates code that runs on any i386 system.  The 64-bit environment sets int to 32 bits and long and pointer to 64 bits and generates code for AMD's x86-64 architecture. For darwin only the -m64 option turns off the -fno-pic and -mdynamic-no-pic options. This seems like the right thing to do to me.  Gilles, have you confirmed that this doesn't break things on the x86_64 platforms? No objection from me.

I've also run the involved tests on an x86_64 machine and it was OK. Gilles Carry <Gilles.Carry@bull.net>.

4) Log Message:
I spent some time looking at the sched_latency test trying to see why it took so long to start the thread.  The java version of the test takes a comparable amount of time to start the thread as it does for each period. The rt-test version was taking an order of magnitude longer.  After digging through the java documentation, I found that the RealtimeThread does not actually start executing until the RealtimeThread.waitForNextPeriod() fulfills the time specified in the PeriodicParameters parameter included in its constructor.  So all the tests are scheduled to run about 1 second after the threads are created.  This gives the system plenty of time to create the thread (a non-realtime code path), set the scheduling parameters and then sleep until the specified run time.  The start latency as measured by the test goes something like this: 

start_time = nanoTime() + 1000000000;
rt = new realtimeThread(sched_param, new \
        PeriodicParameters(start_time, ...), ..., run);

/* by the rtsj specification, this method will not run until start_time */
run() {
        now = nanoTime();
        start_latency = now - start_time;
        ...
}

The rt-tests version went something like this:

start_time = rt_gettime();
create_fifo_thread(periodic_thread, (void*)0, PRIO);

periodic_thread() {
        now = rt_gettime();
        start_latency = now - start;
        ...
}

As you can see, the start_latency is a very different measurement in these two cases.  In the first, it is basically the initial starting latency as measured by the remainder of the loops.  In the second, the execution path of creating the pthread is also counted in the latency.  While this might be an important number for us to keep low in our testing, this is not what the java test is measuring. This patch puts the rt-test version in line with the java version. I also think this is reasonable since the rt-wiki says that we should _NEVER_ create threads on the real-time stage. Signed-off-by: Vernon Mauery <vernux@us.ibm.com>.

The following patches fix execve05 for error reporting when execve() succeeds, and exit synchronization in loaded systems. The last two patches are minor cleanups. execve05 checks that execve() fails if a process has opened the file with write access. However, in case the test fails and execve() succeeds, the default binary (test3) has return code 0, which is interpreted as test success. We get output like that:

<output>
Hello World
</output>
with return code 0 (success)

instead of:

<output>
execve05    1  FAIL  :  Failures reported above
</output>
with return code matching FAIL.

This patch simply changes the success return code from 0 to 3, so that execve() success, and thus test failure, can be properly reported. Signed-off-by: Louis Rilling <Louis.Rilling@kerlabs.com>.

This patch fix an issue in the sync_pipe implementation. The problem is the following : after the creation of a pipe we do not close any file descriptor until the end of a test. Let's imagine the following execution : 
- Process A calls sync_pipe_create
- Process A do a fork (creation of process B)
- Process A calls sync_pipe_wait
---> Process A blocks on sync_pipe_wait
- Process B starts
- Process B exits because of an early error.
In this case, process A never exits. Since it has not closed its write descriptor to the pipe, the pipe is not considered as broken, thus process A is not notified its son is dead. Thus it will wait forever. Renaud Lottiaux <Renaud.Lottiaux@kerlabs.com>.

This patch fixes the writetest.c  to return proper status on Failure/Success. At present the return code of the writest.c is 'zero' for both Success and Failure. As per norms non-zero value should be returned for error , so fixing this testcase. Signed off : Veerendra C <vechandr@in.ibm.com>.

mallocstress stresses the VMM and C library  by spawning N threads which malloc blocks of increasing size until malloc returns NULL. It occur because test doesn't wait for all thread started. already started threads begin allocate memory, so pthread_create can return ENOMEM. my patch added this synchronizing. I use semaphore, because it can wait-for-zero unlike pthread_mutex. sorry, forgot set permission in semget, new patch attached. Andrew Vagin <avagin@gmail.com>.

Reverting back the changes done to fcntl-lock tests in May 2008 release, as this would have canceled the operation Revision *1.1  *done on the /Mon Sep 11 20:40:52 2006 UTC/ by /mreed10 /which added "A patch that added new functionality into the NFSvf lock tests. 
-fixes bugs 
-adds the capability to stress a server with multiple clients"
So it is possible to get back to what 's in ltp-full-20080430 and add my fix: You can fix it by replacing in the locktests.c file
     buf=(char *)malloc(clnt*maxClients);
by
     buf=(char *)malloc(clnt*(maxClients+1));

It seems that hugeshmctl01 doesn't free some hugetlb pages when it fails. ps shows that there is still an instance of hugeshmctl01 left even if hugeshmctl01 is not running which may attach some hugetlb pages. The problem is due to the arbitrary usleep time in hugeshmctl01 which results in incorrect execution order. The intention of the sleep time is to ensure the children call shmat() and pause() before the parent checks shm status and calls stat_cleanup(). But there is no absolute assurance that this sleep always works. In the failure above, the last child process forked by the parent may not run and call shmat() immediately after it's created. When the parent checks shm status, it finds only 3 child attaching the shm instead of 4, so it reports the failure. And then it calls stat_cleanup() to send SIGUSR1 to all children, but since the last child hasn't called pause() yet, SIGUSR1 is handled before pause(). When the last child calls pause(), since there is no further signal to wake it up, it sleeps forever. patch to ensure children can receive and handle SIGUSR1 from parent in pause(). The patch is not to change the arbitrary usleep time since any time is arbitrary though a large time is more acceptable. The patch is to use sigprocmask() to block SIGUSR1 before children sleep for SIGUSR1 from parent, and then call sigsuspend() to unblock SIGUSR1 and sleep for SIGUSR1. By doing so, we may avoid the infinite sleep and keeping attached shm forever so that affect other hugetlb test. In parent process, aonther sigprocmask() is called before usleep(). This has the same effect of sleep more time. By, shenlinf <shenlinf@cn.ibm.com>

The problem is because some of the realtime tests can't be compiled on older distros.

This patch adds a few tests for a variety of bind mounts. More than just shared subtrees are involved as plain --bind and plain --move are used. Read-only bind mounts are not covered by these tests however. Avantika Mathur originally wrote the tests. I've ported them to use LTP APIs and conventions. I've also modified Avantika's scripts to try and robustly cleanup after broken tests so that leftover mounts and failures at any point in a test are cleaned up thoroughly. I've made what efforts I can to follow the conventions I found in LTP FAQs and the source however there's alot here so I may have missed something. Shared bind mounts were introduced in 2.6.15. Because of this we need a tst_kvercmp command which can be invoked from a script. I've added this to ltpapicmd.c. This patch applies to the April release of LTP. I'll also be posting results for x86, x86_64, and ppc64 on a variety of kernels. In order to highlight the results contributed by this patch I've only run this portion of the patched LTP. Comments welcome. Signed-off-by: Matt Helsley <matthltc@us.ibm.com>.

31) Log Message:
This patch modifies testcases to attach their shm segment to addresses chosen by ststem instead of arch-dependent ones. I looked into the history of these testcases, but couldn't find the reason why they specified arch-dependent addresses in the first place. If it has something to do with the page coloring issue, SHMLBA should be in some manners instead of defining arch-dependent addresses.

I see Roy's patch was already checked in. In principle I agree with the patch, but a few things are wrong now and IMHO does not fulfill what it should test any longer. shm05.c -> see my (untested!!!) patch below. Some architectures can only map at specific offsets. Current version "sucessfully" fails, because e.g. hppa can't map at cp+4096. So, it's not failing because the memory regions overlap, although that was intended to be tested...shm06.c now does basically the same test as shm04.c ?!? Doesn't make sense... I would revert the patch for shm06, but maybe others think different???? Other patches seem ok, although I haven't looked too deep into them yet... Helge Deller <deller@gmx.de>.

Your patch looks good to me. It does what I'm intended but failed to do; eliminating explicit arch-dependent code without breaking logics. How about merge the scenario of shm06 into shm04, and then eliminate shm06? Modify shm04 to attach the same segment _twice_ to the child's address space. In this case, the first returned address should be the same as where the parent attaches its segment to while the second returned address should be different.
Helge Deller <deller@gmx.de> wrote:
Yes, this is probably the best idea. Alternatively, just leave shm04 as-is, and do the twice-mapping you mentioned above in shm06. This way we'd keep two simple tests.

Referring to the sync_pipes API, create_sync_pipes(), wait_son_startup(), notify_startup(), which is defined in the: testcases/kernel/syscalls/lib/libtestsuite.[ch], I found the new sync_pipes API very convenient to synchronize processes. However the naming might pose some semantic restrictions on their usages. Since it can be used for makingparent to wait child, and vice versa, perhaps a better naming should be used. For example: sync_pipes_create (), sync_pipes_wait (), sync_pipes_notify(), other names will be good as long as they don't assume the caller is child or parent. Furthermore, since it is also suitable for being used in common test cases, moving  it outside the syscalls's directory to a more common place might be a good idea.

But if you want to make these functions more generic, it should be possible to call sync_pipe_wait / notify several times, which is not possible in the current code since I close file descriptors in these functions.

Profiled Tests:
Basically this was done to enhance the pass/fail criteria usage and allow the user to setup tests configurations according to specific needs. Imagine a test series that may validate a hardware for some latencies (case #1) while another series would validate other criteria (case #2). The same test used in situation #1 will not have the same configuration (arguments) in situation #2. Scripting has to be done for this to achieve. The profile system does this for you. You just have to configure. Not only pass/fail criteria can be set since the profile system simply runs command lines defined in profiles. So any argument can be choosen. ie: a profile can define criteria for tests with or without saving statistics (-s) or simulate jvm (-j). A profile comes as a single file so it is easy to copy from a test machine to another. With this patch, profiles can be used either for test global run (./run.sh) or for an individual directory (./run_auto.sh). For more information, read doc/AUTOMATED_RUN.
This patch is intentionnally global as splitting changes would not make sense.
This includes:
- changes of scripts for automated tests to feature profiles
- individual changes for tests using automation
- a default profile (to be used as an example)
- documentation writing/modifying.

Linux Notes
       On Linux, this routine is a system call only on the Sparc (sparc64) architecture. Libc4 and libc5 only know about the BSD version. Glibc uses the BSD version if the _BSD_SOURCE feature test macro is defined and none of _POSIX_SOURCE, _POSIX_C_SOURCE, _XOPEN_SOURCE, _GNU_SOURCE,  or _SVID_SOURCE is defined.  The System V version is used if _XOPEN_SOURCE is defined. Since the _BSD_SOURCE_ is not defined for LTP testcases, rather they define _XOPEN_SOURCE_, the behaviour is System V, where they expect a signal number instead of signal mask.

Ankita Proposed that:
We have been seeing failures in the prio-wake testcase for a while now. Digged closer into the testcase to find if there was an error lurking in the testcase itself. Did hit a few, which this patch aims to fix. But the failures persist, indicating that something is amiss in the kernel. This patch does the following:
o Make the output of the test more readable. It is now time ordered.
o Bases the pass/fail not only on the order in which the waking up threads update the 'wakeup.arr' but also on the time they woke up. This reduced chances of error.
o Remove an extra lock and unlock on mutex when updating wakeup.arr.

Chirag Jog <chirag@linux.vnet.ibm.com> commented:
I am not convinced that adding a check for wake up time is going to reduce the chances for error. Whichever thread wakes up first, takes the lock,updates priority and time fields. Hence the time field will always be updated in wakeup order. So this is not really adding another useful check. I am ready to be conviced otherwise :)

Ankita Replied:
Yep I agree that now it would not make any difference. But before this patch, we were unlocking the mutex after only updating the running_threads and noting down the wakeup time and try and acquire the lock again to update the wakeup order in wakeup.arr So, there were chances the wakeup time did not match the order in which the wakeup.arr was updated. But yes, with the lock changes, this change would not be required. Shall send the patch again. Thanks for the review :-). So here is the updated patch which takes Chirag's comments into account.

Modified File(s):
ltp/testscripts/test_selinux.sh

4) Log Message:
This patch, which is independent of Jeff's patch, updates the selinux testsuite to run under Fedora 9, and does no harm on Fedora 8. While creating this, I noticed two other things that ultimately need fixing: 
1) The sbin_deprecated.patch adds domain_dyntrans_type() to all the test domains.  If that was truly desired, we should just put it into unconfined_runs_test().  But it shouldn't be necessary - only the test_dyntrans.te and test_dyntrace.te domains should require permissions for dynamic transitions.  I'll let Serge confirm that. 
2) The test scripts are presently relabeling /tmp to test_file_t for the duration of the test.  That's insane - it could break any other running process that tries to access /tmp during the test.  That was not part of our original selinux testsuite and seems to have been introduced when IBM ported it to LTP.  If you are worried about lacking search permission to /tmp in the test domains, then create your own private /test directory or something.  Or just give all test domains permission to search tmp either via unconfined_runs_test() or in test_global.te using the testdomain attribute. Those don't need to be fixed though for this patch to be merged. Also, I noticed some new failures in the tests due to latest Fedora policies giving all domains search permission to all directories.  Not sure if that was intentional - sent a separate note to Dan about that.

RETURN VALUE
       If  name  is  invalid, -1 is returned, and errno is set to EINVAL. Otherwise, the value returned is the value of the system resource and errno is not changed.  In the case of  options, a positive value is  returned  if  a queried option is available, and -1 if it is not.  In the case of limits, -1 means that  there is no definite limit

Return value of sysconf needs to be checked as well and not only depend on errno value. Have made the changes by looking at the code from http://www.comptechdoc.org/os/linux/programming/c/linux_pgcpostest.html. Max Stirling <vicky.irobot@gmail.com>

The Linux port I run on LTP has a minimal set of system calls. It currently does not implement the sysfs system call so I'd like to disable the tests for this system call - at the moment they will fail to compile because __NR_sysfs is undefined. Is there an idiomatic way of doing this? I can either prevent the test compiling completely somehow in the Makefile (e.g. as modify_ldt does) or make the test compile but return BROK perhaps.

Executing f00f testcase in x86 Xeon machines, it failed returning SIGSEGV:

Searching for this issue, I found an old thread in ltp-list discussing broken test-cases (http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=46E5998B.9070903%40redhat.com), where Jeff Burke raise this problem with f00f failing on systems that have the NX bit. But, according to the flags reported in /proc/cpuinfo, the machines where i'm running this testcase seems not to have this NX bit enabled. On /proc/cpuinfo, we also have this line "f00f_bug: no". Would it be useful to select if this testcase should be executed or not? These machines are running a kernel compiled with processor family "Pentium-Pro" (CONFIG_M686=y), which, in according to the kernel config help, "disables the init-time guard against the f00f bug found in earlier Pentiums". Here i have created a patch that seems to fix the testcase using an inline assembly. By, Edjunior Barbosa Machado <emachado@linux.vnet.ibm.com>.

The float_bessel testcases, as a matter of fact, all float_* testcases seem to fail when multiple instances are run concurrently. The failures occur because file sizes don't match or because the number of bytes read don't match the file size. This can be attributed to the parallel instance reading a file before the write to it (by another instance) has completed. In such situations, either the file size has not been updated in the inode header or the file size has been updated but the file's write operation has not been updated completely. To fix this concurrency problem, my suggestion is to check for an existing instance and wait for it to finish before beginning the current instance. Any other concurrency resolution technique may complicate matters. A message to the console indicating such a decision might be added.

7) Log Message:
The idea of the patch is "to make things that should be extern, extern". The means to do this are: 
1. Explicitly declaring variables extern in some places.
2. Defining _USC_LIB_ where appropriate.

My understanding of _USC_LIB_ define is that it exists so the usctest.h header can be included in a lib or non-test source file where you want to use extern declarations of TEST_RETURN, TEST_ERRNO etc. to avoid having a copy of the variable in your library and a copy of the variable in your test. I've added -D_USC_LIB_ to the CFLAGS of library code where necessary, by, Will Newton <will.newton@gmail.com>

The vmsplice01 testcase in LTP failed when run over machines with NFS mount. However after I examined the test case I found that the testcase performs vmsplice() and splice() system calls and it was only splice() that caused the failure.

40) Log Message:
Fixes a concurrency issue in semctl01. This test was using usleep to synchronize tasks. On a heavily loaded system, this synchronization is not enough to ensure execution correctness. This patch is a bit more intrusive than my previous ones.
Patch content :
* Define 2 new functions in kernel/syscalls/lib/libtestsuite.c, used to
* synchronize a father and a son using pipes.
    - create_sync_pipes: create a pair of pipes used for the synchronization,
    - wait_son_startup: function used in the father to wait for its son to start ts execution,
    - notify_startup: function used in the son to notify it has started its execution,
* Add a kernel/syscalls/lib/libtestsuite.h file to cleanly export newly
* defines functions,
* Fix the semctl01test. The idea used to synchronize : 
   - For each task created, the father waits for the son to start its execution using the newly define functions,
   - After the last son has been created, the father do a sleep(1) to give time to the sons to execute the semop function,
The final sleep does not guaranty the sons will have time to do the semop. On a REALLY heavily loaded system, this will still fail... The only solution I see to be sure the son is really blocked on the semop before the father continue its execution it to use the wchan info from /proc/<pid>/wchan file..., by, Renaud Lottiaux <Renaud.Lottiaux@kerlabs.com>

46) Log Message:
We have seen that prio_preempt testcase that is part of realtime tests occasionally hangs. This can be easily recreated on a 8-cpu system, but can be recreated on a 4-cpu system as well when run for a number of iterations. The problem occurs because the first worker thread sometimes fails to call cond_wait on the condvar through which the master thread signals it to start. Since the first thread needs to start the chain of signalling from then on, all other threads just sit in a cond_wait without ever being woken up. The fix is to have a barrier to ensure that the first worker thread doesn't miss the cond_signal. I have tested this patch by running 10s of thousands of iterations of the testcase. Without the patch I can recreate the problem fairly easily, by, Sripathi Kodi <sripathik@in.ibm.com>

26) Log Message:
Here is a second round of cleanup and fixes for the realtime testcases.

1) Make sched_jitter use the create_fifo_thread() library function instead of an open coded solution,
2) Prio-wake calls rt_init() twice, remove the second call,
3) Make sbrk_mutex less verbose by default. One can still use the -v option to get the whole output,
4) It's better to calculate the histogram before saving it. This was introduced in an earlier commit of mine fixing the quantile calculation, 5) Fix runtime displaying of the min and max latencies (when used with -v3). While at it, remove an uneeded avg variable,
6) Various tests still have a hardcoded value for the quantile nines. Use a value automatically calculated from the number of iterations,
7) The log10() call used for automatic quantile nines calculation returns a double result. Cast it to an int. The exp10() call used in stats_quantiles_calc() for checking purposes returns a double result which is compared against a long. Cast it to a long. This allows the following comparison: data->size < (long)exp10(quantiles->nines) to really be false when quantiles->nines has been calculated as log10(data->size).
More generally, it seems that (at least with gcc 4.1.1):
        long i = 10000;
        double f = exp10(log10(i))

        yields (i < f) being true due to rounding,
8) Add latency tracing capability to pthread_kill_latency as is already done on a few other latency tests (gtod_latency, sched_latency, ...),
9) The '::' optional argument specifier for getopt used by the '-v' option is a GNU extension, is not portable and does not work. For example it's not even described in the Debian getopt(3) manpage. Make the '-v' option require a non optional argument,
10)The print buffer is only ever flushed when it is full. Add flushing when the test terminates vi atexit(),
11)The 'period missed' check of the thread first loop should not depend on the thread starting time. This is especially visible on 'slow' platforms where one cannot run the test if thread creation takes a long time. Fix it by removing this dependency. All delays are now calculated relative to when the thread starts,

On a similar pattern as waitpid06 and waitpid07, waitpid08-13 use a failure detection flag (called 'fail' instead of 'flag').

CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID and CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID are also supported besides CLOCK_REALTIME and CLOCK_MONOTONIC. That's the cause of the failure of clock_gettime03, timer_create02 and timer_create04. Another cause is that struct sigevent evp is assigned with invalid values when option is 1. That's the cause of the failure of timer_create02 and timer_create03. CLOCK_REALTIME_HR and CLOCK_MONOTONIC_HR have been removed in the later kernel versions, hence the failures in the test. I am still trying to find out if any kernel versions used to support these. CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID and CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID are supported from 2.6.12 kernel version onwards and the test case needs to be modified for this change. Also in timer_create02.c, setup_test() case1 needs to be modified so as to make evp NULL instead of its members. Since the testcase behaves differently for different kernel versions, a version check needs to be added for making it pass across versions. I'm removing the HR clocks from the tests along with other changes, by, Anoop V. Chakkalakkal <anoop.vijayan@in.ibm.com>

LTP-kill05-bad-check-fix.patch:
  - Fix return value check from shmat. In case of error, this wrong check was leading to a seg-fault.
LTP-kill05-shmid_delete-fix.patch:
 - Fix deletion of the memory segment. Due to the change of process UID during the test, the segment was created by ROOT and deleted (or tried to be deleted) by user "bin". This is of course not possible. And it is also impossible to switch back uid to ROOT. Solution adopted : doing a fork in which the test is performed. The initial process staying with ROOT uid.

15) Log Message:
Huge Changes from Cai Qian <qcai@redhat.com>. Please see the Description
below:

The updated version
has the following improvments,

- simplify maintenance

- fix several bugs

- better automation

- extend support on Debian and Fedora

- merge Poornima Nayak <Poornima.Nayak@in.ibm.com> 's latest patch

- other changes

The new version simplifies code layout, and all tools under lib/
directory are standalone and reusable, all configurable variables are
under the file runkdump.conf. There are also included sample
configuration files for different distros and test components. In
addition, it avoided code duplication by merging RHEL and SLES specified
code in lkdtm module together, and add a checking before hand. The
working flow in main script has also been tidied up. verify and
verify_dump have been unified. unused file "summary" has been deleted.

In previous version,
* The part of comparing kernel version in setup will not work proper
  if the kernel grows to something like 2.7.1 or 2.8.1.
* verify_dump will not able to find previous vmcore if vmcore creation
  and vmcore verfication happen at different hours.
* Other random bugs because of code complexity.

In the new version, once you define everything in a config file, it will
run in an automatically fashion on some of systems, if there is proper
tools installed.

The code has been rewritten in POSIX shell syntax, and made more
portable, and attempted to remove hard-coded stuff as much as
possible. It has been tested fairly on RHEL5.1, SLES10sp1, Debian
unstable, and Fedora 8. If needed I can send you result logs. Sachin
has done a quick test on PPC64 machine running RHEL5.1 and the script
run fine. Poornima has done some code review.
Poornima's patch has been merged,
1. Crashkerenl reservation check is modified to support any craskernel
value.  
2. A message before system reboots
3. Added one more line to 'status' if dump verification passed.
4. Modified 'README' file
5. If kdump start fails for invalid arguments in kdump.conf is fixed
6. Replaced MAKE_OPTS with MAKE_OPTIONS.
7. Removed some unwanted statements.

Other changes included that all tests descriptions have been documented
in doc/ALL_TEST.txt. KNLD (dump over scp with link delay) test case has
been merged into KNSCP (dump over scp). Once LINK_DELAY has been defined
somewhere in configuration file, all test cases (KNSCP and KNNFS)
dumping to a network destination will take advantage of it. If
LINK_DELAY is not defined or equals to 0, KNSCP and KNNFS will just the
same as in previous version.

Better Ways to Integrate "ltp/tools/genload/stress" with  "ltp/runltp" by
Ricardo and Subrata,
This is the second version of Subrata's patch, this is intended to
fully exploit all the features provided by "ltp/tools/genload/stress".

New option:
 -D Run LTP under additional background Load on Secondary Storage

Options that have a different interface:
 -i Run LTP under additional background Load on IO Bus
 -m Run LTP under additional background Load on Main memory

Remember that this change will break the script interface.

 when we're told that the tty closed, else you close the pounder window and 
 various parts of it keep running. 
 run.c

-The readme file has been updated for nfs 
 README

-Disable this test case for kernels below 2.6.17 and not 2.6.16. 
 vmsplice01.c

-This is a patch that allows pounder to record the contents of sysfs when it 
 starts, thus enabling us to take a better snapshot of the system state when
 pounder starts.  It also adds "lspci" into the PCI Device Tree heading per 
 user request. 
 get_hw_info

-Since 2.6.17, _syscall* isn't exported into the user space any more, so all 
 the test cases using _syscall* will fail to be compiled This patch 
 remove _syscall5 from llseek.c and convert to syscall provided by libc.It 
 also includes some cleanups and makes the build cleaner and removes the 
 warning for 
 scsimain.c, llseek.c, scsimain.c

-Backed out the "fix" in Bug 1592647, b/c I don't think the testcase is 
 actually broken. 
 diotest4.c

-touchup code a little to make the expected behavior of test4 more obvious 
 setrlimit01.c


-The random syscall generator has a bug on x86-64 where it only generates 
 random bits for the upper 32 bits of the syscall argument, and then truncates
 the upper 32 bits anyway!  This patch replaces the rand() weirdness with a 
 function that generates N bytes of random data instead. It also adds a -z 
 flag in case one *wants* the zero-arguments behavior; Max Asbock and Russ 
 Weight requested it because zero is a quick way to find kernel code paths
 that don't check userland pointers. 
 CHANGELOG, randasys.c, random_syscall

-Applied fix for Bugs item #1592647 
diotest4.c

-A patch by Jacky Malcles  (The IA-64 architecture sets SHMLBA to 1MB and) The 
 value of the pointer address passed to shmat being set in such a way that
 rounding down to the nearest multiple of SHMLBA results above the current 
 heap. 
 shmt09.c


-Made a change to a comment above the change for 1.11 
 mc_cmds

-Disabling the ping test for now.  The test can pass without this additional 
 check and can cause failures on some distros. 
 mc_commo


-A patch by Suzuki Kp, that removed the definition of HZ from user space for 
 Bug # 28023. 
 adjtimex02.c


-Comment out set -x to remove debug output 
 nfsstat01

LTP-20061017

-A fix for Bug 23587 where the connectathon test failed on linux client with cifs mount to Windows2003 R2 server 
op_chmod.c

-For Linux, 3 is a valide value for the scheduler, as found in the /linux/includ/sched.h file.   For testing and invalid_policy, the invalid_policy value should not be 3 
17-5.c

Ssem_post/5.-1.c According to its intention, #3, call sleep(1) and then alarm(1).  Moving sleep before alarm causes the test to pass  sem_post/8-1.c Although step 3 intended,  The children lock the semaphore. * Make sure the two children are waiting."  Without that caeratn piece of cde which explicity make children wat.  the test will PASS and the children are waiting.  Sem_unlink_1_1 and sem_unline_2_1 "Sem_unlink" is too long for the name of a semaphore for certain architectures 
5-1.c, 8-1.c, 1-1.c, 2-1.c

-When calling pthread_attr_setscope, PHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS is not supported by linux, change it to PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM and the test will pass 
20-1.c, 21-1.c, 21-2.c

-Removed the  ":" after 'v' in the getopts line because it is not using optarg.

22-1.c, 22-2.c

-A patch by David Stevens that fixes: 1) Removes signedness warning by changing the type of valsize from int to socklen_t 2) Correct but in ancillary data - sorce data is unit8_t, memcopy size is "sizeof(int)"; this results in garbage and TBROK on PPC64

15-1.c, 15-2.c


-A fix for bug #27618 that addresses two issues: 1) PAGE_SIZE which was normally 4096, but on the machine it found to 64k ! 2) The size of the file, offset passed. If those values, happen to be on the *Page boundary*, mmap would be happy. But in our case, it was not ! 
fsx-linux.c

-Changing include <posixtest.h> to include "posixtest.h" 
1-1.c

-A patch by Darrick Wong that adds a set of rudimentary IPMI tests to pounder.  They check that the in-kernel IPMI driver can access the machine's BMC/SP (if there is one), query it for status and check for various IPMI 2.0 features.

-Made changes to avoid hardcoding test count 
mkdir03.c, open08.c

-Changed the test to account for SLES 10.  Now the syslog tests will test 
 syslog-ng or syslogd depending on which one is present.  The update was     
 made for syslog01 - syslog10. 

-Corrected the copyright information to reflect SGI, instead of Cray, which
 was purchased by SGI years ago for files get_high_address.c, search_path.c

-Removed the Ping test. The ping test is now skipped on SLES, but does not 
  affect the execution of the rest of the test in mc_commo	

-Using syscall() rather than _syscall#() macros for the following files:
  sysfs01.c, sysfs02.c, sysfs03.c, sysfs04.c, sysfs05.c, sysfs06.c,  
  sysctl01.c, sysctl03.c, sysctl04.c, sysctl05.c

getdents04.c	

-Added a fix to re-order testcases a little to account for uclinux in 
access05.c, lstat02.c, mknod06.c

-A Correction was made to the name of the testcase in code...was incorrectly 
called signal_test_03  and changed to signal_test_02.c

-A fix to  get the max pid value at runtime rather than compile time hardcode 
wait402.c, setpriority04.c,Makefile, getsid02.c

-A fix to remove extraneous include 
swapon02.c

- mc_cmds had two fixes.  The test now uses [ae]th[01] in the ping command 
using the -I option. Also the loop to determine which ethernet interface 
is needed was moved to ensure that the correct ethernet interface was selected.

   function allows the file offset to be set beyond the end of the existing
   end-of-file of the file.  If data is later written at this point,
   subsequent reads of the data is in the gap returns bytes of zeros until
   data is actually written into the gap.
 - In the testcase semget05.c the value of MAXIDS was changed for the specific
   machine by reading the system limit for SEMMNI - The maximum number of
   semaphore sets. This is a fix for bug 24745

   which tend to cause problems with the testcase  setregid03.c,
 - A patch submitted by Jacky Malcles that fixes the problem where
   i0_getevents() return value is not checked and may return 0 if
   no events are available and may generate a SIGSEGV in the testcase

-Added a patch from Darrick Wong to reduce the memory requirements of 
 pounder's ramsnaketes
-Added a patch for crash01.c from Olof Johansson <olof@lixom.net>
 POWER5 has coherent icache, but POWER4, PPC970 and some other processors
 lack it. The standard dcbst/icbi/isync is needed to avoid using the not
 so random (or stale) data instead.

 and setresuid03  to pull the [gs]etre* prototypes from headers rather than 
 defining them ourself
-Made changes to setreuid01,setreuid02,setreuid03,setreuid04,and setreuid05

- Added a change to getpriority01 to combine the TEST_RETURN and TEST_ERRNO 
  if check so that we always display PASS or FAIL messages as pointed out 
  by Isaac Wilcox
- Added a patch to make the output of fork07 deterministic.
  Specifically, make sure stdout is flushed before forking 100 times,
  else you can get 101 copies of the output.  This only seems to happen
  if glibc notices that stdout is a regular file, but in my test setup
  stdout is always redirected to a file and compared with something.
-Changed the declaration for setup and cleanup from extern in the 
 following files:

 alarm01,chdir02,chown01,close08,creat09,dup0,dup04,execl01,execle01,execlp01,
 execv01,execve01,execvp01,fchmod01,fchown01,fcntl02,fcntl03,fcntl04,fcntl05,

- Fixed ftp01 and telnet01 seems designed to run with non-root user connection
  when the user name is set to RUSER environment variable.
  However, it is incomplete.ftp01 creates a directory whose permission is root.

  following patch fixes the problem
- Increased USER_PRECISION to 2200 to take into account the processes switching time nanosleep02
- The attached patch fixes a swapon cross compile build error I ran into
  recently. I verified that RH9 self hosted and cross compile builds now

  can build and execute the test without it now.
- Change for defect 13778, when the /var/log/messages file is first moved, the first write fails
- The SIGINT sighandler will set the "intinitr" flag to 1 for the children. But if the
  "runtime" is small( a command line argument passed, the testcases were running
  for 5 secs here), it may happen that the SIGINT may be recieved before the
  child initialize the flag to 0, and which may lead to a hang
- Change to exclude lib6 directory from default build since it breaks earlier Distros
- Added code to handle cases where certain distros don't define AI_V4MAPPED in /usr/include/netdb.h
