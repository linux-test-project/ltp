vmstat compiles with latest gcc-3.x
vmstat does 64-bit time

procps-3.0.0 --> procps-3.0.1

sysctl handles net/ipv4/conf/eth1.0123/tag (VLAN interface)
sysctl handles net.ipv4.conf.eth1/0123.tag (VLAN interface)
"ps" is now about 2x faster than in procps-2.x.x
"ps -F" now documented
w works in KOI8-R locale
vmstat documentation update
"skill -n blah blah blah" lets you test options
simple "make && make install" now

procps-2.x.x --> procps-3.0.0

designed to support Linux 2.0 through 2.5.41 and beyond
new top, with optional: color, windowing, SMP stats
runs faster
more "it crashes" bugs fixed
top shows IO-wait time
vmstat can show active/inactive memory stats
real-time info supported in ps
correct "ps -o size" and "ps --sort size"
new maintainers
reduced memory usage for ps
allow large PIDs to be specified
SELINUX support is just a recompile away
the "F" column shrank, so "ps -l" has more command name room
64-bit time reduces the overflow problem
support S/390, IA-64 emulator, and user-mode Linux
oldps is gone
configure script -- use "make -f Makefile.noam" as a backup
"w" program better at determining what a user is doing
more stable
code at http://procps.sf.net/ now (SourceForge)

Earlier changes, for those not using Debian already:

more stable
runs faster
-F format option
better error reporting in ps for unknown format specifiers
BSD's sysctl options -b and -X
top displays well on large-memory systems
old BSD-style select-by-PID ("ps l$$")
15-character user names
ps 'f' ASCII art forest fixed
