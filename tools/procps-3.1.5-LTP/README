COMPATIBILITY

    This code is intended for use with Linux 2.0.xx and above.
    Both libc 5 and libc 6 should work.

INSTALLATION

    make
    make install

    If you wish to test before installing, use the scripts
    named t, v, and p to ensure the correct libproc
    is used during your testing.

    If you need to add a compiler option, use CC to do it:
    make CC='gcc -foo'

    Debian users should use the Debian bug tracking system.
    Email to albert@users.sf.net or csmall@debian.org or
    procps-feedback@lists.sf.net will also work.
