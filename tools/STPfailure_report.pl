#   FILE        : STPfailure_report.pl
#   DESCRIPTION : A script that will retrieve the run results through the net from
#		  the STP results and then finds the corresponding source code
#		  file in your LTP tree for each failure.  It then prints the
#		  description and details for each to STDOUT.
#   REQUIREMENTS: LWP::Simple, File::Find, and Text::Wrap must be installed
#   AUTHOR      : Bryce Harrington <bryce@osdl.org>
#   HISTORY     :
#       04/28/2004 Robbie Williamson (robbiew@austin.ibm.com)
#               Adapted for and added to LTP
