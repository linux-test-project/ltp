The libpounder.sh File
======================
The "libpounder.sh" file defines most of the environment variables used in the test
suite and referenced throughout the documentation. These variables are not
intended to be modified by the user, although they can be if customization is desired.
Below is a brief description of these variables (see libpounder.sh for details):

	DATE			- the current date, used for logging
	DEFAULT_SCHEDPACK	- name of the default test scheduler, "default"
	TESTS			- list of scripts from the test_scripts/ directory
	BUILDS			- list of scripts from the build_scripts/ directory
	POUNDER_HOME		- the pounder/ directory
	POUNDER_PIDFILE		- pid file created when running pounder
	POUNDER_LOGLOCAL	- the log/ directory where output of ALL pounder runs
				get logged
	POUNDER_LOGDIR		- the log/$DATE directory where output of only the
				current pounder run get logged
	POUNDER_TMPDIR		- the tmp/ directory used for storing temporary files
				used for test runs
	POUNDER_OPTDIR		- the opt/ directory used for storing third party packages
				used by subtests, which can be fetched from web or from
				a user-created cache (see $POUNDER_CACHE below)
	POUNDER_SRCDIR		- the src/ directory containing source files packaged with
				pounder
	POUNDER_VERSION		- the pounder version
	NR_CPUS			- the number of cpus on the system

The config File
===============
The "config" file defines a few environment variables that ARE intended to be modified
by the user for customizing pounder runs. The variables are described below:

	DURATION		- Time in seconds for pounder to run. Setting this variable
				to 0 will not put an upper bound on pounder run time.

	MAX_FAILURES		- Maximum number of test failures allowed for each subtest
				using infinite_loop or timed_loop (see the "Running Tests Repeatedly"
				section in SCHEDULER for more info on these two procedures) before aborting.
				Setting this variable to 0 will not put an upper bound on any
				subtest failures.


	NFS_LOGGING             - Enables/disables NFS logging. Setting this variable to
				1 will enable NFS logging of pounder output; pounder will
                             	log output to remote directory on NFS server specified
                                by $NFS_LOGDIR and  $NFS_LOGSERVER (see below), which
                                will be mounted on $POUNDER_LOGLOCAL (see libpounder.sh).
                                Setting this variable to 0 will disable this feature; all
				output for pounder runs will be stored locally directly in
				$POUNDER_LOGLOCAL instead.

	NFS_LOGSERVER           - IP address of the NFS server to use for logging pounder results.
				NFS_LOGGING should be enabled to use this feature.

	NFS_LOGDIR		- Path to the log directory on $NFS_LOGSERVER; If $NFS_LOGGING
				is enabled, pounder will attempt to mount $NFS_LOGSERVER:$NFS_LOGDIR/
				on $POUNDER_LOGLOCAL (see libpounder.sh).

	POUNDER_CACHE  		- Address of the cache to use for fetching outside packages,
                        	The cache is a user-created web-accessible directory
                        	containing cached tarballs/scripts/etc. used for
                        	the various tests you intend to build. This is optional
                        	but useful for saving download time and keeping everything in one place.

				For instance, the build_kernel subtest requires downloading a
				linux kernel tarball during build time (see build_scripts/build_kernel).
				Instead of calling "wget http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/$TARNAME"
				to retrieve the tarball, we can pre-download and store it in a user-created online
				directory, then call "wget ${POUNDER_CACHE}${TARNAME}," where POUNDER_CACHE
				is the address of the directory. Other provided subtests: bonnie++, lame, ipmitool,
				and memtest also make use of this cache.

				Examples of some things you may want to include in your cache for building
				the provided tests:
					bonnie++-1.03e.tgz	(for the bonnie++ subtest)
					linux-2.6.39.tar.gz	(for the build_kernel subtest)
					ipmitool-1.8.9.tar.gz	(for the ipmitool subtest)
					...

				These can be found in $POUNDER_OPTDIR after you run "make install" on the
				default package.

	[These variables below are used by specific subtests contained in the provided default
	test scheduler, but they can be incorporated into other user-defined subtests as well.]

	DO_X_TESTS		- 0 disables X system testing, 1 enables X system testing.
				Used by the xterm_stress subtest.


	NFS_SERVER=0		- IP address of the NFS server to use for nfs and ping_nfs
				subtests. Setting this variable to 0 disables nfs testing.

	NTP_SERVER		The NTP server to use. By default, it's set to pool.ntp.org.
				Used by the time_drift subtest.
