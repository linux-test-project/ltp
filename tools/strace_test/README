Strace Test

Introduction:
Strace Test is designed to test the kernel by calling syscalls improperly.  
It uses ltp as a base to generate realistic syscalls and then it randomly
calls improper variations of those system calls. 

The tests are started by root but they are run with user permisions.  The root
user needs to restart the tests around every 10 seconds.

Usage:
./go_go.sh [user][max_tests][test_percent]
        user => username to the scripts under
   max_tests => maximun concurrent tests to run
test_percent => percent of the syscalls to test

Strace Test is distributed under the GPL
Strace, and LTP are GPL as well.
