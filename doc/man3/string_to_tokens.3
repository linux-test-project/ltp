.TH STRING_TO_TOKEN 3 07/25/2000 "Linux Test Project"
.SH NAME
string_to_tokens \- Break a string into its tokens
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB
int string_to_tokens(arg_string, arg_array, array_size, separator)
char *arg_string;
char *arg_array[];
int array_size;
char *separator;
\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
This function parses the string \fIarg_string\fR, placing pointers to
the \fIseparator\fR separated tokens into the elements of \fIarg_array\fR.
The array is terminated with a null pointer.
\fIarg_array\fR must contains at least \fIarray_size\fR elements.
Only the first \fIarray_size\fR minus one tokens will be placed into
\fIarg_array\fR.  If there are more than \fIarray_size\fR-1 tokens, the rest are
ignored by this routine.
.RE

.SH "SEE ALSO"
strtok(3).

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
This function returns the number of \fIseparator\fR separated tokens that
were found in \fIarg_string\fR.
If \fIarg_array\fR or \fIseparator\fR is NULL or \fIarray_size\fR is less than 2,
-1 is returned.

.SH BUGS
This function uses \fBstrtok()\fR to parse \fIarg_string\fR, and thus
physically alters \fIarg_string\fR by placing null characters where the
separators originally were.
