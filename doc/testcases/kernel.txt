<testname=doio>
	<description>
		a general purpose io initiator with system call and
		write logging. See doio.h for the structure which defines
		what doio requests should look like.

		Currently doio can handle read,write,reada,writea,ssread,
		sswrite, and many varieties of listio requests.
		For disk io, if the O_SSD flag is set doio will allocate
		the appropriate amount of ssd and do the transfer

		thus, doio
		can handle all of the primitive types of file io.

		1. Verify that the system call utime() fails to set the modification
		and access times of a file to the current time, under the following
		constraints,

		The times argument is null.

		The user ID of the process is not "root".

		The file is not owned by the user ID of the process.

		The user ID of the process does not have write access to the
		file.
		2. Verify that the system call utime() fails to set the modification
		and access times of a file if the specified file doesn't exist.
