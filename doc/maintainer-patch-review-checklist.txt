# Maintainer Patch Review Checklist

Patchset should be tested locally and ideally also in maintainer's fork in
GitHub Actions on GitHub.

NOTE: Travis does only build testing, passing the CI means only that the
      test compiles fine on variety of different distributions and
      releases.

The test should be executed at least once locally and should PASS as well.

Commit messages should have

* Author's `Signed-off-by` tag
* Committer's `Reviewed-by` or `Signed-off-by` tag
* Check also mailing lists for other reviewers / testers tags, notes and failure reports
* `Fixes: hash` if it fixes particular LTP commit
* `Fixes: #N` if it fixes github issue number N, so it's automatically closed

After patch is accepted or rejected, set correct state and archive in
https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/ltp/list/[LTP patchwork instance].

Also update LTP WIKI (git URL https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp.wiki.git)
if touch `doc/*.txt`.

## New tests
New test should

* Have a record in runtest file
* Test should work fine with more than one iteration
  (e.g. run with `-i 100`)
* Have a brief description
* License: the default license for new tests is GPL v2 or later, use
  GPL-2.0-or-later; the licence for test (e.g. GPL-2.0) should not change
  unless test is completely rewritten
* Old copyrights should be kept unless test is completely rewritten

### C tests
* Use new https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp/wiki/Test-Writing-Guidelines#22-writing-a-test-in-c[C API]
* Test binaries are added into corresponding '.gitignore' files
* Check coding style with `make check`
  (more in https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp/wiki/Test-Writing-Guidelines#21-c-coding-style[C coding style])
* Docparse documentation
* If a test is a regression test it should include tags
  (more in https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp/wiki/Test-Writing-Guidelines#2238-test-tags[Test tags])
* When rewriting old tests, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9CClinux[uClinux]
  support should be removed (project has been discontinued).
  E.g. remove `#ifdef UCLINUX`, replace `FORK_OR_VFORK()` with simple `fork()` or `SAFE_FORK()`.

### Shell tests
* Use new https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp/wiki/Test-Writing-Guidelines#23-writing-a-testcase-in-shell[shell API]
* Check coding style with
  https://salsa.debian.org/debian/devscripts/raw/master/scripts/checkbashisms.pl[checkbashism.pl]
  (more in https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp/wiki/Test-Writing-Guidelines#132-shell-coding-style[Shell coding style])
* If a test is a regression test it should include related kernel or glibc commits as a comment
