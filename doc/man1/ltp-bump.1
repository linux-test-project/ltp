.TH BUMP 1 "14 Sep 2000" "LTP" "Linux Test Project"
.SH NAME
ltp-bump \- send signal to tags run by ltp-pan
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBltp-bump [-1] [-s \fIsig\fB] [\fI-a active-file\fB] [tags...]
.SH DESCRIPTION

Bump will send a SIGINT signal to processes, given that each process has a
corresponding tag in an active-file.  The active-file is the same one that is
used by the ltp-pan to start the processes.

If the active file has multiple occurrences of a single tag name then only the
first process will be signaled.  You may specify the tag name multiple times
on the commandline if necessary.

.TP 1i
\fB-1\fP
Send a SIGUSR1 signal.  By default a SIGINT will be sent.
.TP 1i
\fB-a \fIactive_file\fB
A file containing the tagnames, pids, and commands being run by a ltp-pan.  If this
is not specified then the ZOO environment variable will be read for the name of
the directory where the active file can be found.
.TP 1i
\fB-s \fIsig\fB
Used to specify a signal number to send.  By default a SIGINT will be sent.

.in -1i

This is ignored if \fI-a\fP is specified.

.SH FILES
