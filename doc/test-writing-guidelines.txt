LTP Test Writing Guidelines
===========================

This document describes LTP guidelines and LTP test interface and is intended
for anybody who want to write or modify a LTP testcase. It's not a definitive
guide and it's not, by any means, a substitute for common sense.

1. General Rules
----------------

1.1 Simplicity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For all it's worth keep the testcases simple or better as simple as possible.
The kernel and libc are tricky beasts and the complexity imposed by their
interfaces is quite high. Concentrate on the interface you want to test and
follow the UNIX philosophy. It's a good idea to make the test as
self-contained as possible too (it should not depend on tools or libraries
that are not widely available).

Do not reinvent the wheel!

* Use LTP standard interface
* Do not add custom PASS/FAIL reporting functions
* Do not write Makefiles from scratch,
  use LTP build system instead, etc.

1.2 Code duplication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copy & paste is a good servant but very poor master. If you are about to copy a
large part of the code from one testcase to another, think what would happen if
you find bug in the code that has been copied all around the tree. What about
moving it to a library instead?

The same goes for short but complicated parts, whenever you are about to copy &
paste a syscall wrapper that packs arguments accordingly to machine
architecture or similarly complicated code, put it into a header instead.

1.3 Coding style
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.3.1 C coding style
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

LTP adopted Linux kernel coding style. If you aren't familiar with its rules
locate 'linux/Documentation/CodingStyle' in the kernel sources and read it,
it's a well written introduction.

There is also
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/plain/scripts/checkpatch.pl[checkpatch.pl]
script from kernel git tree which can be used to check your patches before the
submission.  Please use reasonably recent one.

NOTE: If checkpatch.pl does not report any problems, the code still may be wrong
      as the tool only looks for common mistakes.

1.3.2 Shell coding style
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When writing testcases in shell write in *portable shell* only, it's a good
idea to try to run the test using alternative shell (alternative to bash, for
example dash) too.

*Portable shell* means Shell Command Language as defined by POSIX with a
exception of few widely used extensions, namely 'local' keyword used inside of
functions and '-o' and '-a' test parameters (that are marked as obsolete in
POSIX).

You can either try to run the testcases on Debian which has '/bin/sh' pointing
to 'dash' by default or install 'dash' on your favorite distribution and use
it to run the tests. If your distribution lacks 'dash' package you can always
compile it from http://gondor.apana.org.au/~herbert/dash/files/[source].

Debian also has nice devscript
https://salsa.debian.org/debian/devscripts/raw/master/scripts/checkbashisms.pl[checkbashism.pl]
that can be used to check for non-portable shell code.

Here are some common sense style rules for shell

* Keep lines under 80 chars

* Use tabs for indentation

* Keep things simple, avoid unnecessary subshells

* Don't do confusing things (i.e. don't name your functions like common shell
  commands, etc.)

* Quote variables

* Be consistent

1.4 Commenting code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Comments can sometimes save you day but they can easily do more harm than
good. There has been several cases where comments and actual implementation
were drifting slowly apart which yielded into API misuses and hard to find
bugs. Remember there is only one thing worse than no documentation, wrong
documentation.

Generally everybody should write code that is obvious (which unfortunately
isn't always possible). If there is a code that needs to be commented keep it
short and to the point. Never ever comment the obvious.

In case of LTP testcases it's customary to add a paragraph with highlevel test
description somewhere at the beginning of the file (usually right under the GPL
header). This helps other people to understand the overall goal of the test
before they dive into the technical details.

1.5 Backwards compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LTP test should be as backward compatible as possible. Think of an enterprise
distributions with long term support (more than five years since the initial
release) or of an embedded platform that needs to use several years old
toolchain supplied by the manufacturer.

Therefore LTP test for more current features should be able to cope with older
systems. It should at least compile fine and if it's not appropriate for the
configuration it should return 'TCONF' (see test interface description below).

There are several types of checks we use:

The *configure script* is usually used to detect availability of a function
declarations in system headers. It's used to disable tests at compile time.

We also have runtime kernel version detection that can be used to disable
tests at runtime.

Checking the *errno* value is another type of runtime check. Most of the
syscalls returns either 'EINVAL' or 'ENOSYS' when syscall was not implemented
or was disabled upon kernel compilation.

Sometimes it also makes sense to define a few macros instead of creating
configure test. One example are Linux specific POSIX clock ids in
'include/lapi/posix_clocks.h'.

1.6 Dealing with messed up legacy code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LTP contains a lot of old and messy code and we are cleaning it up as fast as
we can but despite the efforts there is still a lot. If you start modifying
old or a messed up testcase and your changes are more complicated than simple
typo fixes you should do a cleanup first (in a separate patch). It's easier to
review the changes if you separate the formatting fixes from the changes that
affects the test behavior.

The same goes for moving files. If you need a rename or move file do it in a
separate patch.

1.7 License
~~~~~~~~~~~

Code contributed to LTP should be licensed under GPLv2+ (GNU GPL version 2 or
any later version).

Use `SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-or-later`

2. Writing a testcase
---------------------

2.1 LTP Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The structure of LTP is quite simple. Each test is a binary written either in
portable shell or C. The test gets a configuration via environment variables
and/or command line parameters, it prints additional information into the
stdout and reports overall success/failure via the exit value.

Tests are generally placed under the 'testcases/' directory. Everything that
is a syscall or (slightly confusingly) libc syscall wrapper goes under
'testcases/kernel/syscalls/'. Then there is 'testcases/open_posix_testsuite'
which is a well maintained fork of the upstream project that has been dead
since 2005 and also a number of directories with tests for more specific
features.

2.1.1 Runtest Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The list of tests to be executed is stored in runtest files under the
'runtest/' directory. The default set of runtest files to be executed is
stored in 'scenario_groups/default'. When you add a test you should add
corresponding entries into some runtest file(s) as well.

For syscall tests (these placed under 'testcases/kernel/syscalls/') use
'runtest/syscalls' file, for kernel related tests for memory management we
have 'runtest/mm', etc.

IMPORTANT: The runtest files should have one entry per a test. Creating a
           wrapper that runs all your tests and adding it as a single test
           into runtest file is strongly discouraged.

2.1.2 Datafiles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your test needs datafiles to work, these should be put into a subdirectory
named 'datafiles' and installed into the 'testcases/data/$TCID' directory (to
do that you have to add 'INSTALL_DIR := testcases/data/TCID' into the
'datafiles/Makefile').

You can obtain path to datafiles via $TST_DATAROOT provided by test.sh
'$TST_DATAROOT/...'
or via C function 'tst_dataroot()' provided by libltp:

[source,c]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
const char *dataroot = tst_dataroot();
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Datafiles can also be accessed as '$LTPROOT/testcases/data/$TCID/...',
but '$TST_DATAROOT' and 'tst_dataroot()' are preferred as these can be used
when running testcases directly in git tree as well as from install
location.

The path is constructed according to these rules:

1. if '$LTPROOT' is set, return '$LTPROOT/testcases/data/$TCID'
2. else if 'tst_tmpdir()' was called return '$STARTWD/datafiles'
   (where '$STARTWD' is initial working directory as recorded by 'tst_tmpdir()')
3. else return '$CWD/datafiles'

See 'testcases/commands/file/' for example.

2.1.3 Subexecutables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you test needs to execute a binary, place it in the same directory as the
testcase and name the file starting with '${test_binary_name}_'.  Once the
test is executed by the framework, the path to the directory with all LTP
binaries is added to the '$PATH' and you can execute it just by its name.

TIP: If you need to execute such test from the LTP tree, you can add path to
     current directory to '$PATH' manually with: 'PATH="$PATH:$PWD" ./foo01'.

3. Test Contribution Checklist
------------------------------

NOTE: See also
      https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp/wiki/Maintainer-Patch-Review-Checklist[Maintainer Patch Review Checklist].

1. Test compiles and runs fine (check with `-i 10` too)
2. https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/plain/scripts/checkpatch.pl[checkpatch.pl]
   does not report any errors
3. The runtest entires are in place
4. Test binaries are added into corresponding '.gitignore' files
5. Patches apply over the latest git

3.1 About .gitignore files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are numerous '.gitignore' files in the LTP tree. Usually there is a
'.gitignore' file per a group of tests. The reason for this setup is simple.
It's easier to maintain a '.gitignore' file per directory with tests, rather
than having single file in the project root directory. This way, we don't have
to update all the gitignore files when moving directories, and they get deleted
automatically when a directory with tests is removed.
