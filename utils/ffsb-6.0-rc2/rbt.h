/*
 * ***************************************************************************
 *
 * Container class for a red-black tree ......
 *
 * A binary tree that satisfies the following properties:
 *
 * 1. Every node is either red or black
 * 2. The root node is black
 * 3. Every leaf (NIL) is black
 * 4. If a node is red, both its children are black
 * 5. For each node, all paths from the node to descendant leaf nodes
 *    contain the same number of black nodes
 *
 * Due to points 4 & 5, the depth of a red-black tree containing n nodes
 * is bounded by 2*log2(n+1) (WC).
 *
 *
 * The rb_tree template requires two additional parmeters:
 *
 * - The contained TYPE class represents the objects stored in the tree.
 *   It has to support the copy constructor and the assignment operator (opr)
 * - cmp is a functor used to define the order of objects of class TYPE:
 *   This class has to support an operator() that receives two objects from
 *   the TYPE class and returns a negative, 0, or a positive integer,
 *   depending on the comparison result.
