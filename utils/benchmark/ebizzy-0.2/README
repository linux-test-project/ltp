ebizzy
------

ebizzy is designed to generate a workload resembling common web
application server workloads.  It is highly threaded, has a large
in-memory working set with low locality, and allocates and deallocates
memory frequently.  When running most efficiently, it will max out the
CPU.

Compiling
---------

First configure ebizzy for your platform by typing "./configure".
Currently Linux and Solaris anre supported.  Then type "make".  The
resulting binary will be named "ebizzy".

Running
-------

ebizzy does not require any command line arguments.  To get
results, just run it:

$ ./ebizzy
2569 records/s
real 10.00 s
user  2.74 s
sys   7.24 s

The records per second rate should be as high as possible, and the
system time as low as possible.  Play with the various options to try
to increase this time to see where overhead is coming from.  Note that
the default number of threads is 2 per number of cpus.

An interesting part of this app is difference between memory
allocation using the "always mmap" and "never mmap" flags.  -m is
"always mmap" and -M is "never mmap":

$ ./ebizzy -M
3997 records/s
real 10.00 s
user  3.70 s
sys   5.65 s
$ ./ebizzy -m
2577 records/s
real 10.00 s
user  2.40 s
sys   7.43 s

The output of the above two commands should be quite different.

ebizzy has many command line arguments.  To get a list of them and
their descriptions, type:

$ ./ebizzy -?

Support
-------

There is none.  However, you can try emailing the author with
questions and suggestions.
