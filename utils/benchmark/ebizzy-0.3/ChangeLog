	* Release 0.2.

	* Started reporting a rate of transactions per second rather than
		just measuring the time.

	* Solaris compatibility, thanks to Rodrigo Rubira Branco
		<rrbranco@br.ibm.com> for frequent patches and testing.

	* rand() was limiting scalability, use cheap dumb inline "random"
		function to avoid that.  Thanks to Brian Twichell
		<twichell@us.ibm.com> for finding it and Yong Cai
		<ycai@us.ibm.com> for testing.
