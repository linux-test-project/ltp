 *    FUNCTION NAME     : string_to_tokens
 *
 *    FUNCTION TITLE    : Break a string into its tokens
 *
 *    SYNOPSIS:
 *
 * int string_to_tokens(arg_string, arg_array, array_size, separator)
 *    char *arg_string;
 *    char *arg_array[];
 *    int array_size;
 *    char *separator;
 *
 *    AUTHOR            : Richard Logan
 *
 *    DATE		: 10/94
 *
 *    INITIAL RELEASE   : UNICOS 7.0
 *
 *    DESCRIPTION
 * This function parses the string 'arg_string', placing pointers to
 * the 'separator' separated tokens into the elements of 'arg_array'.
 * The array is terminated with a null pointer.
 * 'arg_array' must contains at least 'array_size' elements.
 * Only the first 'array_size' minus one tokens will be placed into
 * 'arg_array'.  If there are more than 'array_size'-1 tokens, the rest are
 * ignored by this routine.
 *
 *    RETURN VALUE
 * This function returns the number of 'separator' separated tokens that
 * were found in 'arg_string'.
 * If 'arg_array' or 'separator' is NULL or 'array_size' is less than 2, -1 is returned.
 *
 *    WARNING
 * This function uses strtok() to parse 'arg_string', and thus
 * physically alters 'arg_string' by placing null characters where the
 * separators originally were.
 *
 *
