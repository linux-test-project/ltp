/*
 * This module contains code for logging writes to files, and for
 * perusing the resultant logfile.  The main intent of all this is
 * to provide a 'write history' of a file which can be examined to
 * judge the state of a file (ie. whether it is corrupted or not) based
 * on the write activity.
 *
 * The main abstractions available to the user are the wlog_file, and
 * the wlog_rec.  A wlog_file is a handle encapsulating a write logfile.
 * It is initialized with the wlog_open() function.  This handle is
 * then passed to the various wlog_xxx() functions to provide transparent
 * access to the write logfile.
 *
 * The wlog_rec datatype is a structure which contains all the information
 * about a file write.  Examples include the file name, offset, length,
 * pattern, etc.  In addition there is a bit which is cleared/set based
 * on whether or not the write has been confirmed as complete.  This
 * allows the write logfile to contain information on writes which have
 * been initiated, but not yet completed (as in async io).
 *
 * There is also a function to scan a write logfile in reverse order.
 *
 * NOTE:	For target file analysis based on a write logfile, the
 * 		assumption is made that the file being written to is
 * 		locked from simultaneous access, so that the order of
 * 		write completion is predictable.  This is an issue when
 * 		more than 1 process is trying to write data to the same
 *		target file simultaneously.
 *
 * The history file created is a collection of variable length records
 * described by scruct wlog_rec_disk in write_log.h.  See that module for
 * the layout of the data on disk.

 * Write a wlog_rec structure to a write logfile.  Offset is used to

 * record will be appended to the end of the logfile.  Otherwise, the
 * record which exists at the indicated offset will be overlayed.  This
 * is so that we can record writes which are outstanding (with the w_done
 * bit in wrec cleared), but not completed, and then later update the
 * logfile when the write request completes (as with async io).  When
 * offset is >= 0, only the fixed length portion of the record is
 * rewritten.  See text in write_log.h for details on the format of an
 * on-disk record.
 *
 * The return value of the function is the byte offset in the logfile
 * where the record begins.
 *
 * Note:  It is the callers responsibility to make sure that the offset
 * parameter 'points' to a valid record location when a record is to be
 * overlayed.  This is guarenteed by saving the return value of a previous
 * call to wlog_record_write() which wrote the record to be overlayed.
 *
 * Note2:  The on-disk version of the wlog_rec is MUCH different than
 * the user version.  Don't expect to od the logfile and see data formatted
 * as it is in the wlog_rec structure.  Considerable data packing takes
 * place before the record is written.
